"The photos sat in the box for years. When I finally opened it yesterday, I couldn't stop smiling, but I immediately closed it again.","Emotional Progression:
The person appears to experience a mixture of joy and sadness upon opening the photos that were stored away for years. Initially, the joy of seeing the old photographs causes them to smile, but this joy is quickly followed by an immediate and perhaps stronger feeling of sadness that makes them close the box again.

Emotional Context:
The person might have been storing these photographs from a period in their life that brought them great happiness but also some pain or sorrow. The act of opening the photos, after a long time, triggers memories associated with both joy and sadness. This could be due to various reasons such as remembering happy moments with loved ones who are no longer around, or facing reminders of hardships endured during that period.

Past Events:
It is likely that these photos were taken during a significant phase in the person's life - perhaps a relationship, a trip, a time of personal growth, or any other event that left an impact on them. The fact that the photos have been stored away for years suggests that revisiting these memories might bring up a mix of emotions due to the passage of time and potential changes in their current circumstances.",0,mistral
"I practiced the speech a hundred times until it was perfect. Standing here now, I keep intentionally making mistakes.","Emotional Progression:
The individual's emotions appear to progress from determination and confidence to self-doubt and intentional error-making. Initially, the person practices the speech a hundred times with perfection in mind, suggesting a high level of confidence and determination. However, as they stand in front of an audience, they intentionally make mistakes, indicating a shift towards doubt or nervousness.

Emotional Context:
The person's initial practice suggests that they are preparing for a significant event, such as a presentation, speech, or performance. The repetition and pursuit of perfection indicate a high level of importance attached to this event. However, their intentional mistakes while delivering the speech imply that they may be experiencing stage fright, anxiety, or self-doubt in the actual performance.

Past Events:
Based on the emotional progression and context provided, it can be inferred that the individual had a positive and confident mindset during preparation for an important event. However, past events could have included experiences that made them fearful or anxious about public speaking, leading to self-doubt and intentional mistakes during the actual performance. For example, they might have experienced a previous failure or criticism in a similar situation, causing them to doubt their abilities.

"The scholarship letter came today. I've been tracing my parents' signatures over and over, but haven't signed my own name yet.","Emotional Progression:
In this text, the person experiences a mix of emotions that can be described as excitement, anxiety, and reverence or respect towards their parents. The initial excitement stems from receiving the scholarship letter, a significant achievement. However, they have not signed it yet, showing a sense of hesitation or uncertainty. This hesitation might come from the weight of responsibility that comes with accepting the scholarship and the significance of their parents' role in this decision.

Emotional Context:
The person is likely a student who has recently been awarded a scholarship. The scholarship letter requires the student to sign it, symbolizing their acceptance. The student is repeatedly tracing their parents' signatures, indicating that they look up to their parents and value their wisdom. They may be seeking approval or guidance from their parents before making this significant decision, hence the hesitation in signing their own name.

Past Events:
Based on the context and emotions expressed, it can be inferred that the student might have discussed the scholarship with their parents before. The student's respect for their parents' signatures suggests a close relationship where they seek advice and guidance. It is possible that the student was unsure about accepting the scholarship initially but, after discussing it with their parents, decided to apply. Now, having received the letter, they are seeking their parents' approval before making the decision official by signing the letter. This sequence of events demonstrates the student's maturity and thoughtfulness in handling such a significant decision.",0,mistral
"The painting took years to finish. The moment I signed it, I turned it to face the wall.","Emotional Progression:
The individual appears to experience a mix of pride and shame upon completing the painting. Pride is evident as they worked diligently on the piece for several years, suggesting a deep investment and love for their creation. However, upon signing it, they display a negative emotion, turning the painting away from view, which could indicate shame or dissatisfaction with their work.

Emotional Context:
The act of turning the painting to face the wall may be an attempt by the individual to hide their creation due to perceived flaws or because they are not fully satisfied with it. They might fear criticism or rejection from others, which could explain the mixture of emotions felt upon completing the work.

Past Events:
It is likely that the individual has faced past criticisms or negative feedback on their artwork, causing them to develop a sense of insecurity about their creative abilities. This could have led them to work meticulously and extensively on this particular painting, hoping to create something flawless. However, upon completion, they may have found minor imperfections that triggered feelings of shame or disappointment, leading to the decision to hide the piece rather than share it with others.",0,mistral
"I finally acheived the perfect routine. Now I deliberately wake up at random times, just to prove I can.","Emotional Progression:
The person initially seems to express a positive emotion, such as satisfaction or pride, regarding their achievement of a perfect routine. However, this initial positive emotion is later contrasted with a somewhat contradictory action or behavior - waking up at random times. This suggests a complex emotional state, potentially including a sense of control or independence (waking up at random times) coupled with an underlying insecurity or need for validation (proving they can do so).

Emotional Context:
The person's initial achievement of a perfect routine could be the culmination of hard work and dedication. However, their subsequent action of deliberately disrupting this routine by waking up at random times might suggest that they are testing their own self-discipline and control. This could stem from a fear of losing control or a need to prove their ability to adapt to new circumstances, despite having a well-structured routine.

Past Events:
Given the complex emotions expressed in the text, it's challenging to pinpoint specific past events based on limited information. However, one possibility could be that this person had faced challenges in maintaining a routine in the past, which led to feelings of frustration or failure. The achievement of a perfect routine could be a response to these past struggles, but the subsequent action of waking up at random times might indicate lingering concerns about maintaining control and consistency. Alternatively, this person may have experienced a sudden change in their life that disrupted their routine (e.g., a job change, move, or relationship shift), causing them to question their ability to adapt and maintain control over their own life.",0,mistral
"The children's hands were outstretched, but I walked past them. With each step away, my pockets felt heavier.","Emotional Progression:
The text describes a person who is experiencing a mix of emotions, including sadness and guilt. Initially, the person encounters the children who extend their hands, which implies they are asking for something, possibly money or help. However, the person walks past them without helping. This action suggests a sense of indifference or distance from the children's situation, but it also triggers feelings of sadness as the person continues to walk away. The heaviness in the person's pockets could symbolize the burden of not helping others or the weight of unease and regret.

   Emotional Context:
The person in this text is likely someone who regularly encounters street children asking for help, but they have chosen not to assist them consistently. This choice might be due to a variety of reasons, such as lack of resources, discomfort with the situation, or perhaps a belief that giving money perpetuates the cycle of begging. However, the person's feelings of sadness and guilt suggest that they feel remorse for not helping and are troubled by their inaction. The heaviness in their pockets may signify the burden of these conflicting emotions or the material resources they could have used to help but chose not to.

   Past Events:
To understand why this person is walking past the children without helping, we need to consider their previous experiences and interactions with street children. It's possible that the person has had encounters where helping led to disappointment, such as the child using the money for something other than what was intended, or the child not improving their situation despite receiving help. This pattern could lead to feelings of frustration, disillusionment, and a hesitance to continue assisting. However, the current encounter triggers feelings of sadness and guilt, suggesting that this time, the person may have wanted to help but found themselves unable or unwilling to do so. This could indicate a change in their attitude towards helping street children or an internal struggle to reconcile their past experiences with their current emotions.",0,mistral
"They called me 'teacher' while I was there. Now back home, each time I hear that word, I pretend not to notice.","Emotional Progression:
The person in the text exhibits a progression of emotions. Initially, they were likely proud or honored when people referred to them as 'teacher'. However, upon returning home, their feelings have changed, and they now feign indifference each time they hear that word. This emotional shift may be due to feeling misunderstood or unappreciated upon returning home, possibly because the expectations others had for them as a teacher were not met.

Emotional Context:
Upon leaving home, this person may have taken on the role of a teacher somewhere else. The pride and honor they felt in being called 'teacher' likely stemmed from achieving that position after leaving their original home. However, upon returning home, they might have found that people had certain expectations of them based on the title 'teacher', which they were unable to meet. This could be due to various reasons such as teaching methods not being accepted or understood, not having immediate success in the classroom, or feeling out of place in their former community.

Past Events:
To understand the current emotions displayed by this person, we can infer a few past events. First, it is likely that this person left their home to pursue education or a career as a teacher elsewhere. This move may have been met with admiration and pride from their family and community back home, leading to them being referred to as 'teacher'. Upon returning home, however, they might have found it difficult to meet the expectations associated with that title, leading to feelings of disappointment, frustration, or even a sense of failure. This emotional struggle could explain why they now pretend not to notice when people call them 'teacher'.",0,mistral
Everyone celebrated when I fixed the problem. I've been creating smaller ones ever since.,"Emotional Progression:
In the given text, the person appears to experience a progression of emotions that can be categorized as pride and regret. Initially, they felt proud or satisfied upon successfully fixing the problem as everyone celebrated. However, this success was followed by feelings of remorse or self-criticism when they realized they had been creating smaller problems since then.

Emotional Context:
After resolving the initial problem, the person experienced a sense of accomplishment and pride due to their significant contribution. This feeling may have stemmed from the recognition and appreciation received from others during the celebration. However, rather than feeling content or relieved after fixing the issue, they started creating smaller problems, perhaps in an attempt to maintain their relevance or control, leading to feelings of regret and self-criticism.

Past Events:
Based on the emotional progression and context provided, it is likely that the person was previously facing a challenging situation or problem that required their attention and expertise. Upon successfully resolving this problem, they gained recognition and appreciation from others, which might have boosted their ego and confidence. However, instead of taking time to rest or reflect on their accomplishments, the person may have felt an unspoken pressure to maintain their high status or prove their worth by creating smaller problems to address. This constant need for control or attention could be rooted in past experiences, such as a lack of recognition or appreciation for their contributions. This repeated pattern eventually led to feelings of regret and self-criticism as they realized the negative impact of their actions.",0,mistral
The old café finally reopened after the accident. I visit daily but always order something different from my usual.,"Emotional Progression:
In this text, the reader seems to be experiencing a mix of nostalgia, anticipation, and hesitation upon the reopening of an old café following an accident. The reader visits the café daily, yet chooses something different from their usual order. This suggests a complex emotional response, where they feel connected to the past (nostalgia) but also uncertain about returning to their previous routine (hesitation). Simultaneously, they exhibit excitement and anticipation towards the reopening, which is evident in their daily visits.

Emotional Context:
The old café likely held significant memories for the reader, possibly a favorite hangout or meeting spot from the past. The accident might have been something traumatic that forced its closure, causing the reader to miss it deeply. However, they find themselves hesitant to return to their usual order, perhaps fearing that doing so would bring back memories of the past or remind them of the accident. Instead, they are choosing different items to order as a way to move on from the past but still maintain a connection.

Past Events:
The past events that led to this situation might involve the café being a favorite gathering spot for the reader and their friends or family. The accident could have been anything ranging from a fire, robbery, or structural issue that forced its closure. The emotional attachment to the café is strong enough that the reader feels compelled to visit daily but is also struggling with returning to their usual routine due to the trauma associated with the accident.",0,mistral
"Each like on my recovery progress made me stronger. Now fully healed, I keep posting photos from six months ago.","Emotional Progression:
The text shows a progression of emotions, starting with strength and possibly pride due to each like received on their recovery progress. This is followed by a sense of nostalgia or perhaps longing as they look back at photos from six months ago, now that they are fully healed.

Emotional Context:
The person seems to have undergone a significant recovery process, possibly from an illness or injury. Each like on their progress served as validation and strengthened their resolve. Once they were fully healed, they felt a sense of accomplishment but also a longing for the past, as they now find themselves reflecting on their journey through photos taken six months ago.

Past Events:
It is likely that the person had a challenging time during their recovery, which they overcame with determination and resilience. The likes they received on their progress posts might have come from friends, family, or online community who were supportive throughout this journey. Once they achieved full healing, they may have felt a sense of satisfaction, achievement, and perhaps even relief, leading them to reflect on their past struggle and the progress they made.",0,mistral
"The marathon medal weighs nothing. Yet somehow, I can't lift my arms to put it on the wall.","**Emotional Progression**
   The text presents a mixture of emotions including sadness, frustration, and accomplishment. The individual has just completed a marathon, which is an achievement that often brings feelings of pride and accomplishment. However, the inability to lift their arms to put the medal on the wall suggests they may be experiencing negative emotions like sadness or disappointment.

   **Emotional Context**
   The marathon medal represents the successful completion of a significant challenge. It signifies the individual's hard work, perseverance, and determination over a long period. However, their inability to lift their arms suggests that they are emotionally drained or overwhelmed by something beyond just physical exhaustion. This could be due to unmet expectations (frustration), regret about performance (disappointment), or even nostalgia for the journey leading up to the marathon (sadness).

   **Past Events**
   To understand the current emotional state, we need to look at the events leading up to the marathon. It's possible that the individual had a personal best time in mind, but failed to meet it. This could lead to feelings of frustration and disappointment. Alternatively, the journey to the marathon may have been filled with hardships or losses that have left them feeling sentimental and nostalgic. Perhaps they trained through a significant life event, such as the loss of a loved one or a major career change, and now the marathon serves as a reminder of those struggles. The inability to lift their arms could be a manifestation of these complex emotions.",0,mistral
The concert hall echoed with applause. I left my violin on stage and took the subway home.,"**Emotional Progression**
   The text seems to depict a combination of feelings such as happiness, relief, and sadness. Initially, the person was likely excited or thrilled about their performance, given the context of the concert hall echoing with applause. This suggests happiness and pride. However, leaving the violin on stage may indicate a sudden change in emotions, possibly fear or embarrassment. The decision to leave and take the subway home might suggest relief, as if they were trying to escape the situation. Finally, taking the subway home could also signify sadness or melancholy, as though the person feels let down or disappointed about the incident with their violin.

   **Emotional Context**
   The applause in the concert hall suggests that the performance was successful and well-received. This positive feedback would typically elicit feelings of happiness and pride for the performer. However, leaving the violin on stage could be due to various reasons. It might have been a momentary lapse of concentration, a distraction, or even an intentional decision made under the influence of the relief and relief emotions. The subway ride home could symbolize escaping from the immediate aftermath of the incident with the violin, potentially allowing the person some time to process their feelings of embarrassment, fear, sadness, or any other complex emotions they may have experienced.

   **Past Events**
   To understand the past events leading up to this situation, we can make an educated guess based on the emotional progression and context provided. It is likely that the person had practiced diligently for their concert and was confident about their performance. The applause in the concert hall suggests a successful performance. However, something unexpected happened during or immediately after their performance, causing them to leave their violin on stage. This incident might have been due to a technical issue, a momentary distraction, or even an unforeseen stage fright episode. The person's decision to take the subway home rather than addressing the issue suggests that they may have felt overwhelmed or uncertain about how to handle the situation at that moment.",0,mistral
"The messages kept coming, but I stopped reading them. Today, I finally deleted the app, then immediately downloaded it again.","Emotional Progression:
The person appears to be experiencing a complex mixture of feelings such as indecision, ambivalence, and possibly, a sense of regret tinged with longing or hope. Initially, they felt overwhelmed by the continuous influx of messages, which led them to stop reading them. This action suggests frustration or maybe even anger at the constant barrage of communication. However, their subsequent decision to delete the app but immediately re-download it indicates a conflict within themselves, potentially oscillating between wanting to cut off contact and desiring connection.

Emotional Context:
The person seems to be dealing with a relationship or friendship that has been strained by misunderstandings, distance, or some form of disagreement. The continued messages could represent attempts at reconciliation or communication, which the person is struggling to handle due to their emotional state. Their actions of deleting and immediately re-installing the app suggest an internal struggle: they want to disconnect from the situation, but at the same time, they are drawn back in by a lingering hope or desire for resolution or connection.

Past Events:
Based on the emotional progression and context provided, it is possible that the person experienced some form of conflict or disagreement with someone important to them. This could be a romantic partner, family member, friend, or colleague. The continued messages could represent efforts at reconciliation or communication, which the person finds difficult to handle due to feelings of frustration, anger, or confusion. Their inability to maintain a permanent disconnection from the situation suggests that there is still some unresolved emotion or hope for resolution. It's also possible that this situation has been ongoing for some time, leading to the person's current state of emotional turmoil and indecision.",0,mistral
"Everyone says I won brilliantly. I keep watching the recording, counting all the small mistakes nobody else notices.","Emotional Progression:
The person seems to experience a mix of pride and self-doubt after their victory. Initially, they are proud since everyone is praising them for winning brilliantly. However, upon rewatching the recording and scrutinizing every tiny mistake, they start doubting themselves, realizing that there were minor errors that others might not have noticed.

Emotional Context:
The person's pride stems from their successful performance in whatever competition or task they were involved in. Their self-doubt arises when they analyze their performance more critically, identifying flaws and mistakes that may have contributed to their victory but were overlooked by others. The act of rewatching the recording repeatedly suggests an attempt to validate their achievement while seeking self-improvement.

Past Events:
Based on the emotional context, it can be inferred that the person recently accomplished something significant, such as winning a competition or giving a presentation. To maintain their confidence and improve their skills, they chose to rewatch the recording of their performance. The repetitive watching indicates self-reflection and an intention to identify areas for improvement, which ultimately led to feelings of pride and self-doubt.

"Each birthday card arrived right on time for twenty years. This year's sits unopened on my desk, though I check it's still there every morning.","Emotional Progression:
The text suggests a progression of emotions from anticipation to melancholy and then perhaps acceptance or resignation. Initially, the person eagerly awaited the birthday card for twenty years, suggesting a strong sentiment of joy and expectation associated with this tradition. However, as the card remains unopened on their desk, there's a shift in emotion, likely disappointment, frustration, or even a sense of loss, due to the change in their relationship or circumstances that has caused this tradition to be broken. Yet, they continue to check the card every morning, implying a lingering hope or perhaps a need to hold onto the past, which could suggest acceptance or resignation.

Emotional Context:
The person appears to have a significant emotional attachment to the annual tradition of receiving a birthday card. This tradition might symbolize connection, love, or friendship with someone special. The fact that the card has arrived every year for two decades reinforces this sentiment. However, this year, something has disrupted this tradition, causing distress and confusion for the person. They may be going through a difficult time in their relationship, have lost touch with the sender of the card, or are experiencing some other life change that prevents them from fully enjoying or acknowledging the card.

Past Events:
To understand the past events that led to this situation, we can consider several possibilities. The person may have had a falling out with the sender of the card, or the sender might have passed away. Alternatively, the person could be going through a difficult period in their life, such as a divorce, job loss, or health issue, that has caused them to lose touch with close friends or family members. Regardless of the specifics, it seems clear that something significant has changed in the relationship between the person and the sender of the card, leading to the tradition being broken this year.",0,mistral
"After years of silence, their number appeared on my phone. I've been calling it hourly, hanging up before it rings.","Emotional Progression:
The text suggests a progression of emotions including anxiety, anticipation, fear, and possibly regret or guilt. At first, the person feels anxious about interacting with the unknown caller again after years of silence. This is shown by their actions of calling the number hourly, but not letting it ring, indicating fear or apprehension about the potential conversation.

Emotional Context:
The repeated calls and hesitation to answer the phone suggest a complicated relationship between the person and the caller. The years of silence could have been due to a fallout, misunderstanding, or unresolved issues. The hourly calls might be a sign of the person's desire for closure or reconnection, but their fear of answering could stem from anxiety about what might be said, what might change, or what memories might resurface.

Past Events:
Given the context of the emotions expressed and the length of the silence, it can be inferred that there was a significant event or series of events that led to this long silence between the two individuals. It could be a disagreement, a betrayal, or even a loss. The person's current actions suggest they are revisiting this past event, perhaps due to some new information, a change in circumstances, or simply because they cannot forget about it.

"The fan mail arrives daily now. I've started writing responses to each one, but my sent folder remains empty.","-------------------------------
   **Emotional Progression**
   In this text, the author exhibits a blend of anticipation, satisfaction, and disappointment. Initially, the author is anticipating the arrival of fan mail, as indicated by ""The fan mail arrives daily now."" This suggests excitement or pleasure at receiving such communication. However, upon starting to respond to these messages, the author experiences satisfaction due to the action taken. Yet, this satisfaction is not reflected in the outcome since the sent folder remains empty, resulting in disappointment.

  -------------------------------
   **Emotional Context**
   The author's emotional progression can be understood in the context of interacting with fans and engaging in a dialogue that is likely meaningful to them. The daily arrival of fan mail indicates a consistent connection with these individuals. Writing responses demonstrates an effort to foster this relationship, which brings satisfaction. However, since the sent emails do not reach their destination, the author feels disappointed and frustrated as they are unable to fully reciprocate or acknowledge the fans' messages.

  -------------------------------
   **Past Events**

The author likely values these communications from their fans and takes pride in responding to them.

The houseplant I neglected for months finally bloomed. I moved it to the basement where no one can see it.,"Emotional Progression:
The emotional progression in this text suggests a mix of pride, shame, and detachment. At first, the person might have felt a sense of neglect or guilt due to their negligence towards the houseplant for months. However, upon seeing the plant bloom, they experience a sudden surge of pride or accomplishment, as the plant's growth despite their neglect is a testament to its resilience. This positive emotion is quickly followed by shame or embarrassment, as they hide the plant in the basement where no one can see it, indicating a desire to conceal their success or the plant itself due to feelings of guilt or inadequacy.

   Emotional Context:
The person's emotional response stems from a complex relationship with the houseplant and their own self-perception. Their neglect could be due to a busy lifestyle, lack of attention, or even feeling unworthy of taking care of something that requires nurturing. However, when the plant blooms despite these negligent conditions, it triggers a sense of pride and accomplishment, as they realize they have contributed to its growth in some way. This positive emotion is short-lived, as they feel shame or embarrassment for their initial neglect, leading them to hide the plant in the basement where no one can see it.

   Past Events:
The past events that led to this situation could be numerous. It's possible that the person was dealing with stress, workload, or personal issues that prevented them from taking proper care of their houseplant. Despite these challenges, the plant continued to grow, which eventually led to its blooming. This unexpected growth might have reminded the person of their past failures or inabilities, leading to feelings of guilt and embarrassment upon seeing the beautiful bloom. This could explain why they chose to hide the plant in the basement instead of celebrating its achievement.",0,mistral
"Their childhood photos were worth a fortune at auction. I outbid everyone, then left them in the gallery's lost and found.","Emotional Progression:
The person seems to be experiencing a complex blend of emotions, primarily regret and detachment. Initially, they felt triumphant when they outbid everyone for their childhood photos at an auction. However, this feeling of triumph quickly gave way to regret as they left the photos in the gallery's lost and found, suggesting that they realized the sentimental value these photos held for them or perhaps for others who might have had a connection with those images.

Emotional Context:
The person's actions at the auction suggest excitement and anticipation, as they were willing to outbid everyone else. However, their decision to leave the photos in the lost and found shows remorse and a sense of detachment from the items that once held significant emotional value for them. The photos may have reminded them of cherished memories from their childhood or perhaps a loved one who is no longer around.

Past Events:
Considering the complex emotions expressed, it seems likely that these childhood photos were not just ordinary photographs but had deep personal significance for the person. Perhaps they were part of a family album, containing memories of happier times with relatives or friends who are no longer in their lives. The auction could have been an attempt to reclaim those lost moments, only for the person to be overcome by regret upon leaving the photos behind. This regret might stem from realizing that material possessions cannot bring back the emotions and experiences associated with the memories they represent.",0,mistral
"The cancer screening came back negative. I keep the hospital bracelet on, hidden under my watch.","Emotional Progression:
The text presents a combination of relief and unease in the person, as they have received news about a negative cancer screening result but still choose to hold onto their hospital bracelet. This act of keeping the bracelet suggests that while they are relieved by the negative result, they may also be experiencing lingering anxiety or fear related to their health status. The fact that they hide it under their watch indicates a sense of private ownership and perhaps a continued awareness and vigilance towards their health.

Emotional Context:
The person has likely gone through a difficult period of waiting for the results of their cancer screening. They may have experienced anxiety, fear, and worry during this time. The negative result brings relief, but they continue to hold onto the bracelet as a symbol of their recent ordeal and a reminder to stay vigilant about their health. The fact that they keep it hidden under their watch suggests they want to maintain some level of control over the situation while also acknowledging its presence in their life.

Past Events:

"The language app says I'm fluent now. I practice my accent in secret, making it sound worse than before.","Emotional Progression:
The individual seems to experience a mix of pride and self-doubt. Initially, they may have felt a sense of achievement when the language app declared them as fluent. However, this pride is quickly overshadowed by self-doubt as they find that their accent practice results in it sounding worse than before.

Emotional Context:
The individual's pride stems from receiving recognition for their fluency from the language app. This recognition validates their efforts and time invested in learning the language. However, when they practice their accent and it worsens, their self-doubt arises as they compare their current ability to their perceived expectations of fluent speakers.

Past Events:
It is likely that the individual has spent a significant amount of time learning and practicing the language with the intention of improving their fluency. They may have attended classes or lessons, practiced regularly, and possibly even immersed themselves in the language by watching movies, listening to music, or reading books in the target language. The decline in their accent could suggest that they are currently in a phase where they are practicing with native speakers or using the language more frequently, leading to noticeable differences in their pronunciation. This could also indicate that they have been practicing incorrectly or focusing on the wrong aspects of the language. Alternatively, it is possible that they are experiencing frustration due to hitting a plateau in their learning journey and struggling to improve further.",0,mistral
