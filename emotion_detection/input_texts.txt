I just got promoted at work!
I miss my family so much it hurts.
I can't believe they would do this to me!
Wow, I never expected this to happen!
I love spending time with you.
I'm so nervous about tomorrow's presentation.
This is the happiest day of my life!
The news about the accident made me scared.
I'm furious about how they treated my friend.
Seeing my old photos makes me nostalgic.
