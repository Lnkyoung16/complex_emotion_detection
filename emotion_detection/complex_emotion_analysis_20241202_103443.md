2. **Self-criticism vs. Self-acceptance**: The speaker's tendency to focus on minor mistakes suggests a critical inner voice, which may be at odds with the need for self-acceptance and self-compassion.

**Context and Background**

### What Led to This Situation?

* This reaction might have been triggered by past experiences where external validation didn't match internal expectations, leading to feelings of inadequacy or disappointment.

### Relationships Involved

### Past Experiences Relevant

* **Past failures or disappointments**: The speaker may have experienced past situations where external validation didn't match internal expectations, leading to feelings of inadequacy or disappointment.
* **Excessive self-criticism**: A history of overly critical self-talk might have contributed to the speaker's current perfectionistic tendencies.

**Future Implications**

### How Might This Affect Future Behavior?

* The speaker's tendency to focus on minor mistakes may lead to:
	+ Overthinking and anxiety in future competitive situations.
	+ Increased self-criticism, potentially hindering their ability to grow or learn from experiences.
