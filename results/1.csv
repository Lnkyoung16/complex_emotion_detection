Cultural nuances:
In many Western cultures, romantic relationships are valued as long-term commitments, often involving emotional investment and trust. This context makes the experience of infidelity particularly impactful, especially when it occurs after 5 years together. The hurt and betrayal expressed might be amplified by societal expectations for loyalty within committed relationships.

3. **Disappointment**: This can be inferred from the length of time the partners have been together (5 years), suggesting a level of commitment was expected.

While it's difficult to pinpoint emotions with absolute certainty, the text provides enough context to make an educated guess. The phrase ""just declared bankruptcy"" is particularly telling, as it implies a sense of suddenness and unexpectedness that adds to the emotional impact.

However, without more information about the employee's relationship with the company, their job security, or their personal circumstances, it's impossible to say for certain how they're feeling. A confidence score of 8/10 acknowledges this nuance while still indicating a strong likelihood that sadness is the primary emotion being conveyed.",0,llama3.1:8b

* The use of an exclamation mark at the end of the sentence further reinforces the emotional tone.

However, I wouldn't assign a 100% confidence score because:

**Cultural Nuances:** In many Western cultures, especially those with individualistic values, self-worth is deeply tied to one's job performance and professional success. Criticism from a superior can be perceived as a personal attack on one's identity and value as an employee.

**Emotional Complexity:**

Emotional Complexity: The primary emotion expressed is **Fear**. Witnessing an accident that could have potentially caused harm or injury can evoke this primal response.

1. **Rescue dog culture**: In some countries, particularly in the US and Canada, there's a strong cultural movement around adopting pets from shelters. This community is often associated with values like compassion, kindness, and social responsibility.
2. **Social media sharing**: People are encouraged to share their personal experiences, including photos and stories about their pets. This creates a sense of connection and community among users.

**Emotional Complexity:** The primary emotion in this text is...

**Joy** (Confidence Score: 8/10)

The use of the word ""just"" suggests that the adoption has recently occurred, and the excitement is still fresh. The phrase ""he already knows how to high five!"" implies a delightful surprise, which adds to the joy. The tone is light-hearted and playful, indicating that the author is thrilled with their new furry friend.

The emotional complexity lies in the implicit message: by sharing this moment on social media, the author is not only celebrating their own happiness but also potentially inspiring others to consider adopting from shelters. This nuance adds a layer of altruism to the primary emotion of joy.

Overall, I'd rate the confidence score for identifying ""joy"" as the primary emotion as 8/10. While it's possible that other emotions like surprise or delight are present as well, joy is the most prominent and dominant feeling in this text.",0,llama3.1:8b

**Context:** The author is sharing a personal experience related to their grandmother's health condition (Alzheimer's). This suggests a context of emotional vulnerability, family dynamics, and potentially some guilt or concern about the situation.

**Cultural Nuances:**

* In many cultures, grandmothers are revered as wise, loving, and nurturing figures. The author's reference to their grandmother implies a deep emotional connection.
* Alzheimer's is often associated with loss of identity, independence, and quality of life for both patients and loved ones. This context adds a layer of sadness and empathy.

* The primary emotion expressed in this text is **sadness**, but it's not an overpowering or dominant feeling. Instead, it's more like a gentle, background hum of sorrow.
* There might also be some underlying emotions like **concern**, **guilt**, or **helplessness**, as the author reflects on their grandmother's condition and their own relationship with her.

**Confidence Score:** 8/10

While we can infer a range of emotions from this text, it's essential to acknowledge that the primary emotion is not explicitly stated. The tone is quite neutral, which might be intentional, given the complexity of Alzheimer's disease and its impact on family dynamics. However, based on the context and cultural nuances, I'd give a confidence score of 8/10 for identifying sadness as the primary emotion.

**Additional Insights:**

* The use of ""didn't recognize me"" is an important detail, implying that the grandmother's memory loss has affected their personal connection.

* A subtle tone of **HUMILITY** might be present, as the winner may acknowledge the competitiveness of the competition and the high caliber of other participants.

**Primary Emotion:** PRIDE (highly likely)

**Realistic Confidence Score:** 9/10

The statement is straightforward and clearly communicates a significant achievement. The use of ""first place"" explicitly conveys superiority, making it unlikely to be misinterpreted as anything else. However, without additional context or emotional tone, it's impossible to know the exact emotional state of the writer, which is why I wouldn't give a 10/10 confidence score.",0,llama3.1:8b

 + There may be underlying emotions such as nostalgia, regret, or guilt (e.g., wondering if they could have done more to prevent the dog's death).

Primary emotion: Grief/Sadness

Confidence score: 8/10
The confidence score reflects my analysis of the text and how well it aligns with common human emotional responses. However, I may not be aware of the writer's personal experiences or emotions, which could lead to some degree of uncertainty.

	+ The fact that the speaker is alone in the house adds to the sense of vulnerability.

The way you look at me makes my heart skip a beat. I've never felt this way before.,"Analysis:

The text is a romantic declaration that conveys a strong sense of attraction and nervousness. The speaker feels seen and desired by the recipient, which has triggered an intense emotional response.

Context: This text appears to be a personal message or a letter from one person to another, likely in a romantic context. It may be exchanged between two individuals who have recently met or reconnected.

Cultural nuances:

* In Western cultures, particularly in the United States and Europe, direct expressions of romantic feelings are often considered acceptable and even expected. However, in more reserved or traditional cultures, such as some Asian or Middle Eastern societies, public displays of affection may be viewed with skepticism or shame.

However, the tone may come across as somewhat clich√©d or overused in popular culture. A more nuanced approach might be to incorporate specific details about the speaker's feelings or experiences, which would increase the confidence score.

To improve the text, consider adding more specificity or depth to the emotions expressed. For example:

* ""The way you look at me makes me feel like I'm home, like I've finally found someone who truly sees me.""
* ""When you smile at me, my heart skips a beat because I feel seen and understood in a way that no one else ever has.""

By adding more detail and subtlety to the emotions expressed, the text can convey a stronger sense of vulnerability and authenticity.",0,llama3.2:3b

* Context: The text is likely written by someone who is a fan of the TV show that was canceled. The cancellation is sudden, implying that there was no prior announcement or warning. The fact that it happened during the middle of the story arc (a ""cliffhanger"") suggests that the show was left in an abrupt and unsatisfying state.
* Cultural nuances: In Western cultures, particularly among fans of serialized TV shows, cliffhangers can be a source of frustration and disappointment. The expectation is often built up over several episodes or seasons, leading to an emotional investment in the story. Canceling a show mid-season can feel like a betrayal of that trust.

However, there's also a hint of sadness and loss, as the writer seems to be mourning the loss of their favorite show. The tone is informal and personal, suggesting a strong emotional connection between the writer and the show.

Context: The text appears to be a personal communication between an individual (likely a patient) and a healthcare professional, likely a doctor or medical specialist. The context suggests that the person has undergone some medical testing, and the doctor is sharing the results with them.

Cultural Nuances:

* In many Western cultures, there is a strong emphasis on honesty and directness in communication, particularly when it comes to health issues. However, this can sometimes come across as insensitive or confrontational.

* There may also be underlying emotions such as uncertainty, vulnerability, or worry about potential health consequences.
* The use of the phrase ""I'm terrified"" suggests that the person is trying to convey a sense of dread or unease, but this might not fully capture their emotional state.

Confidence Score: 8/10

The confidence score is based on my ability to interpret the text and identify the primary emotion. However, there may be nuances in the original context that aren't immediately apparent, which could affect the accuracy of the analysis.

Some potential caveats:

* The text might be a simplified representation of someone's emotional state, as people often don't express their true feelings in written communication.
* The tone and language used (e.g., ""I'm terrified"") might not reflect the person's actual emotions or may be intended to elicit a specific response from the reader.
* Without more context, it's difficult to determine whether the person is experiencing anxiety due to a particular health issue or if they are simply apprehensive about discussing their medical status.",0,llama3.2:3b
Watching my child take their first steps was the most magical moment.,"**Context Analysis**

The text appears to be a personal reflection or anecdote, possibly from a parent or caregiver. The context suggests that the writer is looking back on a significant and emotional experience in their life.

**Cultural Nuances**

In Western cultures, taking one's first steps is often considered a milestone event in a child's development and is commonly celebrated by family and friends. This cultural significance may contribute to the emotional resonance of the moment described in the text.

However, it's worth noting that not all cultures place the same emphasis on physical milestones as a measure of independence or achievement. In some cultures, other developmental markers (e.g., speaking one's first words) may be viewed as more significant.

The use of the phrase ""the most magical moment"" suggests that the event has been imbued with a sense of wonder and enchantment. This is reinforced by the emotional intensity of the experience, which is implied to have been life-changing or memorable.

**Confidence Score**

I would assign a confidence score of 8/10 for this analysis. The text provides sufficient context and emotional cues to suggest that nostalgia is the primary emotion at play. However, it's possible that other emotions (e.g., anxiety, excitement) might be present in the writer's experience, which are not explicitly stated.

The lack of additional details or context makes it difficult to assess the writer's subjective experience with complete accuracy. Nevertheless, based on the language and tone used, nostalgia appears to be a dominant emotion in this text.",0,llama3.2:3b

2. The tone of the text is energetic and celebratory, which is consistent with the typical emotions experienced when winning a significant amount of money.
3. There are no red flags or ambiguous phrases that would suggest alternative emotions, such as anxiety or fear, which might be present in some cases.

1. The text was not written by someone who had actually won a lottery (it's possible to write about winning the lottery without having experienced it).
2. The author's tone or language suggested a more ironic or sarcastic intent, which would indicate a different emotional state.

* Cultural nuances:
 + In many Western cultures, losing one's job can be seen as a common experience, especially during economic downturns. However, the text still conveys a sense of vulnerability and uncertainty, highlighting the emotional impact of such an event on the individual.
 + The use of ""Lost my job today"" instead of ""I was laid off"" or ""I lost my employment"" may be seen as more conversational and relatable, but also somewhat less formal. This choice could be intended to convey a sense of immediate and sudden change, rather than a planned termination.
* Emotional complexity:
 + The primary emotion expressed in the text is likely anxiety or worry about financial stability. The author's concern about paying next month's rent suggests that they are struggling to cope with the loss of income, which is a fundamental aspect of their livelihood.
 + There may also be underlying emotions such as shame, embarrassment, or self-doubt, given the personal nature of the disclosure and the potential stigma associated with job loss. However, these emotions are not explicitly stated in the text.

The primary emotion expressed in the text is anxiety, specifically worry about financial stability. The use of phrases like ""Don't know how I'll pay"" and ""next month's rent"" creates a sense of uncertainty and tension, which suggests that the author is struggling to cope with their situation.

Confidence score: 85% (based on the language, tone, and context)

* Context: The situation described is inherently stressful and anxiety-provoking, evoking a primal fear response. The fact that the person is home alone adds to the sense of vulnerability and isolation.
* Cultural nuances: In many Western cultures, spiders are often viewed as creepy-crawly creatures that evoke a strong sense of unease or fear.

* Emotional complexity: The primary emotion expressed in this text is fear. The description of the spider creates a sense of urgency and anxiety, making the reader feel like they're experiencing the situation alongside the author.

Primary Emotion: Fear

Confidence Score: 90%

The confidence score reflects my confidence in accurately identifying the primary emotion as fear. While there may be some secondary emotions present (e.g., anxiety, vulnerability), fear is the dominant emotional tone of the text. The use of phrases like ""massive spider"" and ""I'm home alone"" creates a sense of danger and isolation, making it likely that fear is the primary emotion being expressed.

However, I wouldn't assign a perfect confidence score because:

1. The text is quite brief and doesn't provide a lot of emotional context.
2. The author's personal experience with spiders or arachnophobia might influence their emotional response, which could lead to some variation in the emotional tone expressed.

 + Additionally, the phrase ""perfect"" implies a level of expectation or idealization, which could indicate that the speaker has high standards for future dates.

Primary emotion: Nostalgia

Confidence score: 8/10

Reasoning:
While the text explicitly states that the first date was ""perfect,"" there is an underlying tone of reflection and reminiscence. The use of the word ""amazing"" also suggests a degree of excitement or enthusiasm, which may not be immediately apparent from the surface-level description. Overall, while the emotion is clear, there are subtle undertones and complexities that make this analysis less straightforward than a simple reading.",0,llama3.2:3b

 + In some coastal communities, sunsets are a regular occurrence, and their beauty can be taken for granted. However, in this context, the text suggests that the writer was particularly impressed by today's sunset, implying that it exceeded their expectations or provided a rare moment of wonder.
* Emotional complexity:
 + The primary emotion expressed in the text is admiration and appreciation for the natural beauty of the sunset. This sentiment is likely to be genuine and heartfelt, as the writer seems to have been moved by the experience.

The text is short but conveys a sense of frustration and disappointment. The speaker has been working on a significant project for three hours, which implies that it's important to them.

Contextual cues:

- The use of ""just died"" implies a sudden and unexpected event, which adds to the sense of frustration.
- The fact that the speaker was about to save their work suggests that they had made significant progress, which increases the emotional impact.
- The phrase ""3-hour project"" gives an idea of the scope and importance of the task.

	+ There might also be a hint of irony or sarcasm, as finishing a PhD can sometimes be accompanied by feelings of exhaustion and uncertainty about the next step.

Primary emotion: Elation/Excitement

Confidence score: 8/10

Reasoning:
The text expresses a clear sense of accomplishment and pride, which suggests that elation/excitement is the primary emotion. The use of exclamation marks and the phrase ""Finally"" also reinforces this interpretation. However, there might be some underlying emotions that are not explicitly stated in the text. To increase confidence in the emotional interpretation, I would need more context or additional information about the writer's tone and language usage.

Possible interpretations:

* Elation/Excitement: 80%
* Relief: 10% (as a secondary emotion)
* Pride: 5% (as an underlying emotion)
* Anxiety/Stress: 5% (as an underlying emotion)

They diagnosed my mom with stage 4 cancer today.,"Analysis:

The text conveys devastating news about someone's mother having been diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer. The language used is straightforward, yet it carries immense emotional weight.

Context:
In many Western cultures, particularly in the United States and Europe, a cancer diagnosis can be a life-altering event that affects not only the individual but also their loved ones. This text likely belongs to this cultural context.

Cultural Nuances:
The text does not contain any explicit cultural references or idioms that would require specific knowledge of another culture's customs or values. However, it's essential to consider the emotional implications of cancer diagnoses in different cultures, as some societies may have varying attitudes towards illness and death.

Emotional Complexity:
This text contains high emotional complexity due to its suddenness, finality, and potential impact on the recipient (presumably a family member). The news is both concrete and life-threatening, leaving little room for denial or escape. This diagnosis will likely evoke strong emotions in those affected, including shock, grief, anger, guilt, and anxiety.

Primary Emotion:
The primary emotion conveyed in this text is sadness, specifically grief. The context of the diagnosis (a serious illness) contributes to a somber atmosphere, which underscores the gravity of the situation.

Confidence Score:
I would rate the confidence score for identifying the primary emotion as high (8/10). While other emotions like fear or frustration might be present, sadness and grief are likely the dominant emotional responses in this scenario. The text's structure, using a simple statement to convey devastating news, contributes to its somber tone.

However, predicting the specific intensity or distribution of emotions among individuals can be challenging due to individual experiences, personality traits, and relationships. Therefore, while I'm confident that sadness is the primary emotion, quantifying the exact emotional spectrum for each person affected might require further context and analysis.",0,llama3.2:3b
"Just rescued a kitten from the street, and it won't stop purring in my arms.","Analysis:

* Context: The text is likely written by someone who has recently adopted or rescued an animal, possibly a kitten. The act of rescuing an animal can evoke strong emotions and create a sense of responsibility and attachment.
* Cultural nuances: In many Western cultures, cats are often viewed as independent and aloof animals, so it's common for people to be surprised when their cat displays affectionate behavior. This text may be more relatable in cultures where pets are highly valued and considered part of the family.
* Emotional complexity: The primary emotion expressed in this text is joy or happiness (99.9% confidence score). The use of words like ""rescued"" and ""won't stop purring"" convey a sense of excitement, relief, and affection. However, there may also be undertones of responsibility, concern for the animal's well-being, and possibly a hint of guilt for not rescuing it sooner.

The text is written in an informal, conversational tone, suggesting that it is from a personal social media post or a private message. The brevity and simplicity of the text contribute to its emotional impact, making the reader feel like they are experiencing the moment alongside the writer.

The primary emotion expressed in this text is happiness, but with a nuanced undertone of responsibility and possibly some guilt for not rescuing the kitten sooner.",0,llama3.2:3b
Can't believe my partner cheated on me after 5 years together.,"Analysis:

The text expresses a strong negative emotion, specifically betrayal, hurt, anger, and possibly sadness. The use of ""Can't believe"" implies a sense of disbelief and shock, which suggests that the speaker is struggling to process this event.

Contextually, the situation appears to be a personal one, likely involving a romantic relationship. The mention of 5 years together indicates a significant level of commitment and investment in the relationship. However, the fact that it ended due to infidelity implies a deep breach of trust.

Cultural nuances:

* In many cultures, particularly in Western societies, infidelity is considered a serious betrayal and can lead to significant emotional distress.
* The stigma surrounding cheating partners may also influence the speaker's reaction, making them feel ashamed or embarrassed about their own perceived flaws (e.g., ""how could they do this to me?"").
* Additionally, the fact that this occurred after 5 years together implies a sense of loyalty and commitment that has been betrayed.

Emotional complexity:

* The text does not explicitly mention any specific emotions, but based on context, it appears to be primarily driven by feelings of hurt, anger, and betrayal.
* There may also be underlying emotions like sadness, shame, or regret. For example, the speaker might be wondering if they missed any signs or warning signs (e.g., ""Why didn't I see this coming?"").

Primary emotion:

Based on context and emotional complexity, the primary emotion expressed in this text is likely **betrayal**. However, since betrayal often encompasses multiple emotions like hurt, anger, sadness, and shame, it's reasonable to assign a high confidence score for this interpretation.

Confidence score: 9/10 (high confidence due to contextual cues, cultural norms surrounding infidelity, and the emotional complexity of the situation)

Alternative interpretations:

* While ""betrayal"" is the most likely primary emotion, other emotions like **hurt**, **anger**, or **sadness** could also be interpreted with varying degrees of accuracy. A more nuanced analysis would require additional context or information about the speaker's emotional state.
* It's possible that the speaker is using a more conversational tone to express their emotions, which might lead some readers to interpret the text as having multiple primary emotions. However, based on the provided context and cultural norms, betrayal remains the most likely primary emotion.",0,llama3.2:3b
The audience gave my performance a standing ovation!,"Analysis:

* Context: The text is likely from an individual's personal experience or a triumphant moment in their life, possibly related to a performance, competition, or achievement. The context suggests that the speaker has received recognition and praise for their efforts.
* Cultural nuances:
	+ In many Western cultures, a standing ovation is a sign of extreme admiration and respect for a performer or individual who has delivered an outstanding show or experience. This cultural reference reinforces the positive tone of the statement.
	+ However, it's worth noting that some cultures may not have a similar tradition of standing ovations or may interpret this gesture differently. For example, in some Asian cultures, a standing ovation might be seen as impolite or overly enthusiastic.
* Emotional complexity:
	+ The primary emotion expressed in the text is pride and satisfaction, likely stemming from the recognition received for their performance. This feeling is likely accompanied by feelings of gratitude, happiness, and possibly even relief (if there were concerns about receiving such a response).
	+ However, it's also possible that there may be underlying emotions such as nervousness or anxiety related to public performances, which are now mitigated by the positive reaction.

Primary emotion: Pride/Satisfaction

Confidence score: 9/10

The confidence score is high because:

* The text explicitly states a fact (the audience gave a standing ovation), which lends credibility to the speaker's emotions.
* The tone of the statement is triumphant and celebratory, indicating that the speaker genuinely feels proud and satisfied with their performance.
* The lack of ambiguity or hedging language suggests that the speaker is sincere in their expression of pride.",0,llama3.2:3b
My childhood best friend stopped talking to me without any explanation.,"Analysis:

The text conveys a sense of shock, hurt, and possibly betrayal. The use of the word ""stopped"" implies a sudden and unexpected change in behavior, which can be perceived as a personal attack or rejection. The lack of an explanation from the childhood best friend adds to the emotional complexity, leaving the speaker feeling confused, angry, and maybe even abandoned.

Contextual considerations:

* The text assumes a close friendship between two individuals, which makes the sudden estrangement more surprising and hurtful.
* The fact that this incident occurred during childhood suggests that the speaker may have invested significant emotions and attachment in the relationship, making it harder to cope with its loss.
* The lack of explanation implies that there may be underlying issues or unresolved conflicts between the two friends, which could be a source of ongoing emotional pain.

Cultural nuances:

* In many cultures, childhood friendships are deeply valued and often considered lifelong bonds. Breaking off these relationships can be seen as a significant loss, leading to feelings of regret, anger, and disappointment.
* The assumption that friends should remain close and supportive throughout life is also evident in Western societies, where maintaining long-term friendships is highly prized.

Emotional complexity:

The emotional impact of this event can vary widely depending on individual circumstances. Some possible emotions include:
1. Shock: The suddenness of the friendship's end can lead to feelings of disorientation.
2. Anger: The lack of an explanation might fuel resentment and frustration.
3. Hurt: The perceived abandonment or rejection by a close friend can be deeply painful.
4. Regret: Wondering what was done wrong or missed opportunities can contribute to sadness.
5. Sadness: Accepting that the friendship has ended, with no clear path for reconciliation.

Confidence score:

I estimate the primary emotion as hurt (70-80% confidence), followed by anger and shock, which are close second (10-20% each). Regret might be present but is less likely to dominate the emotional experience. The complexity of emotions, however, makes it difficult to assign a single, definitive score.

Please note that this analysis is subjective and may vary depending on individual interpretations and cultural backgrounds.",0,llama3.2:3b

Context: The text is likely from a personal or social media update, possibly during an actual tornado event or in anticipation of one.

Cultural Nuances: In many Western cultures, especially in the United States, tornadoes are associated with fear, destruction, and chaos. The use of words like ""terrifying"" conveys a sense of anxiety and apprehension. However, regional variations in weather perceptions may influence individual reactions to tornado warnings.

Emotional Complexity:

1. Fear: The primary emotion expressed is fear, which is a natural response to the threat of a tornado.
2. Anxiety: There's also an underlying sense of anxiety, as the situation may cause concern for personal safety or property.
3. Helplessness: The use of ""the sky looks terrifying"" implies a feeling of helplessness, as if there's nothing that can be done to mitigate the danger.

Confidence Score:
The primary emotion, fear, is relatively easy to infer from the text with a confidence score of 90%. However, determining the exact emotional complexity and nuances may require additional context or insight into the individual's perspective. A score of 60% would suggest that while the primary emotion is clear, there may be some ambiguity or subtlety in the underlying emotions.",0,llama3.2:3b

**Primary emotion:**

The primary emotion expressed in this text is **EXCITEMENT**. The writer's use of capital letters and enthusiastic language (""My crush just asked me out on a date!"") conveys their excitement and eagerness about the event.

**Confidence score:** I would rate the confidence level of the writer as 80%. While they are clearly excited, there may be some underlying uncertainty or anxiety about how to respond or what will happen next. However, based on the text alone, it appears that the writer is feeling optimistic and enthusiastic about this development.

**Additional insights:**

* The use of capital letters emphasizes the significance of this event for the writer.
* The phrase ""My crush just asked me out"" suggests a sense of anticipation and nervousness about how to respond.

Found out I'm going to be a parent - I'm overwhelmed with joy!,"Analysis:

The text expresses excitement and happiness about becoming a parent, which is a significant life event for many individuals. The use of the word ""overwhelmed"" suggests that the speaker may also feel anxious or uncertain about this new responsibility.

Primary emotion:

The primary emotion expressed in this text is JOY (confidence score: 8/10). The use of the word ""overwhelmed with joy"" clearly conveys the speaker's excitement and happiness about becoming a parent. However, the mention of overwhelm also introduces a note of complexity to the emotion, suggesting that the speaker may be grappling with some uncertainty or anxiety.

Subsequent emotions:

* ANXIETY (confidence score: 4/10): The use of the word ""overwhelmed"" implies a sense of apprehension or unease about taking on new responsibilities.
* PRIDE (confidence score: 2/10): While the speaker is excited to become a parent, there is no clear indication of pride in this message.

    * The emotional response to such an incident may be influenced by cultural attitudes toward personal property, safety, and perceived vulnerability.

Nobody showed up to my graduation ceremony.,"Analysis:

The given text conveys a sense of disappointment, isolation, and possibly even sadness or betrayal. The speaker mentions that ""nobody showed up"" to their graduation ceremony, which suggests a feeling of being left out or unvalued.

Contextualizing the text, it's essential to consider the cultural norms surrounding graduations and the significance of this milestone event. In many cultures, graduations are celebrated with family, friends, and community members. The absence of attendees in the speaker's graduation ceremony may indicate a lack of support or appreciation for their hard work.

Found out my best friend has been talking behind my back for months.,"Analysis:

The text conveys a significant betrayal of trust, which is a deeply personal and emotional experience. The context suggests that the speaker had a close relationship with their best friend, expecting mutual support and loyalty.

However, it's possible that the speaker might experience a range of emotions over time, and the initial anger could give way to more introspective feelings like regret, guilt, or sadness. The confidence score is based on the assumption that the primary emotion is indeed anger, but the actual emotional landscape may be more complex and nuanced.",0,llama3.2:3b

* Context: The text is likely from an artist's social media post or a personal update, expressing excitement about a successful sale of one of their artworks. This context suggests that the artist has invested significant time and effort into creating this art piece.
* Cultural nuances:
	+ In many cultures, especially in Western societies, success and achievement are often measured by financial gain. The emphasis on ""ten times more"" implies a sense of surprise and excitement at the level of success achieved.

* The emphasis on ""ten times more"" implies a sense of surprise, which is consistent with an elated emotional state.
* The text does not contain any contradictory or ambiguous language that would suggest alternative emotions.

* The tone of the post were more ambivalent or tongue-in-cheek (e.g., using humor to mask any underlying anxieties).",0,llama3.2:3b
The company I worked at for 20 years just declared bankruptcy.,"Analysis:

* Context: The text is a personal statement about an individual's experience with a significant life event (company bankruptcy). It suggests that the writer has invested a substantial amount of time and resources into their career, making this event emotionally impactful.
* Cultural nuances: In many cultures, especially in business-oriented societies, job security and financial stability are deeply ingrained values.

This confidence score reflects my conviction that the writer is likely expressing a negative emotional state. However, I am not entirely certain about the specific emotions involved, as some readers might interpret this situation with anger or frustration rather than sadness. Additionally, individual experiences and cultural backgrounds can influence how people perceive and express their emotions.

Potential underlying emotions:

* Anger: The company's failure could be perceived as a betrayal or a personal affront.

* Guilt: Regretting decisions made during the writer's time at the company, such as poor performance or missed opportunities.
* Frustration: Disappointment with the lack of support or communication from management.

Just held my newborn niece for the first time - she's perfect!,"Analysis:

The text expresses a sense of joy, wonder, and contentment. The use of the word ""perfect"" to describe the newborn niece suggests that the speaker is experiencing a strong emotional connection with her. The context implies that this moment is significant, perhaps marking a new stage in the speaker's life.

Cultural nuances:
- In Western cultures, especially in countries with a strong emphasis on family and parenthood, holding a newborn baby for the first time can be a deeply personal and emotionally charged experience.
- The cultural expectation of parental love and devotion may contribute to the intensity of emotions experienced by new parents.
- The use of ""newborn niece"" instead of ""new grandbaby"" suggests that this is the speaker's first child, making it an even more significant moment.

Emotional complexity:
- The text only scratches the surface of the emotional depth involved in this experience. New parents often face a mix of emotions, including exhaustion, worry, and pride.
- The use of ""perfect"" to describe the niece might oversimplify the complexities of parenthood, where imperfections and challenges are inevitable.
- The speaker's emotional state may be influenced by their personal expectations, relationships with family members, and societal pressures.

Primary emotion: Joy

Confidence score: 8/10
While the text primarily conveys joy, it is a complex emotion that might be accompanied by other feelings.

* Context: The text appears to be a personal expression of emotions following a negative interaction with an employer or authority figure. The setting is likely a workplace or professional environment, where the speaker feels vulnerable and exposed.
* Cultural nuances: The use of ""completely worthless"" as an emotional state is culturally specific. In many Western cultures, self-worth is deeply tied to one's job performance, social status, and professional achievements. This phrase reflects a common cultural narrative that equates self-worth with productivity and competence. However, this narrative can be limiting and damaging, particularly for individuals who struggle with anxiety, depression, or imposter syndrome.
* Emotional complexity: The text reveals a high level of emotional vulnerability, as the speaker feels attacked and belittled by their boss's criticism. This reaction suggests that the speaker is sensitive to feedback and has invested a significant amount of self-worth in their professional identity.

Primary emotion:

The primary emotion expressed in this text is shame. However, it's essential to recognize that shame can manifest in different ways. In this case, the speaker's feelings of worthlessness are likely rooted in shame, but they may also be influenced by other emotions like hurt, anger, and disappointment.

Confidence score: 80% (moderate)

This confidence score is based on the following factors:

* The text is brief and concise, which suggests that the speaker has had time to reflect on their emotions.
* The language used is straightforward and clear, without any apparent attempt to manipulate or deceive the reader.
* However, the phrase ""completely worthless"" may be an exaggeration, suggesting that the speaker is struggling with self-doubt or has some level of emotional regulation issues.

A more confident assessment might suggest that the speaker is experiencing a range of emotions, including shame, hurt, and frustration. A lower confidence score would imply that the text is ambiguous or uncertain, or that the speaker's emotions are more complex than initially apparent.",0,llama3.2:3b
Witnessed a car accident right in front of me - I'm still shaking.,"Analysis:

The text describes a traumatic experience where the speaker witnessed a car accident firsthand. The use of the phrase ""right in front of me"" emphasizes the closeness of the event, making it even more unsettling for the reader.

Contextually, this text may be part of a personal reflection or a first-person account shared on social media, a blog, or a journal. The fact that the speaker is still shaking suggests that the incident had a significant emotional impact.

Cultural nuances:

* In many cultures, witnessing an accident can be considered a traumatic experience, and it's not uncommon for people to report feeling shaken or disturbed after such events.
* However, some cultures may be more stoic or less expressive of emotions in public, which could affect how the speaker chooses to describe their experience.

Emotional complexity:

* The primary emotion expressed is fear or shock, as evidenced by the phrase ""I'm still shaking."" This suggests that the speaker was deeply affected by what they witnessed.
* There may also be underlying emotions such as anxiety, worry, or even guilt (e.g., if they feel responsible for something), which are not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the context.

Confidence score:

The primary emotion can be confidently identified as fear/shock, with a confidence score of 0.9 (out of 1). The emotional complexity is more nuanced, and while it's possible to infer additional emotions, they are less clear-cut and may require further analysis or context to determine with certainty.

Additional insights:

* The brevity and simplicity of the text belie the depth of emotion experienced by the speaker.
* The fact that the speaker is still shaking suggests that this incident has had a lasting impact on their emotional state.
* If this were a shared account, it might prompt an outpouring of support or empathy from others.",0,llama3.2:3b

* The language used (e.g., ""Just got,"" ""favorite things"") suggests a sense of excitement and anticipation.
* The tone is informal, which makes me feel more comfortable interpreting the emotional nuances.

However, I'm not 100% confident because:

* Emotions can be subjective, and readers may interpret the text differently.
* Without more context about the relationship between mom and the writer, it's possible that other emotions like affection or nostalgia could also play a role in their interpretation.",0,llama3.2:3b

Contextually, the text assumes that the reader is familiar with the concept of manuscript rejection in the context of academic or literary publishing. The mention of ""tenth time"" implies a sense of repetition and cumulative frustration, which may evoke sympathy from the reader.

Culturally, the text taps into universal experiences of failure and disappointment, making it relatable to many people who have faced similar setbacks in their personal or professional lives. However, the text also assumes a level of cultural awareness that is specific to the academic or literary world, where rejection can be a particularly painful experience.

Emotional complexity:

The primary emotion expressed in the text is disappointment. However, there may be underlying emotions such as frustration, anxiety, and possibly even shame or self-doubt. The writer's repeated rejection may have led to feelings of inadequacy or a lack of confidence in their abilities. The text also hints at a sense of helplessness, as the writer has tried numerous times but still faced rejection.

Confidence score:

I would rate the emotional complexity and confidence level of this text as follows:

* Emotional complexity: 8/10 (The text conveys a range of emotions, including disappointment, frustration, and possibly shame or self-doubt. However, the emotional nuances are not overly complex or subtle.)
* Confidence level: 6/10 (The writer's tone is fairly direct and straightforward, but there may be undertones of vulnerability or uncertainty that suggest they are still grappling with their emotions.)

Overall, the text effectively conveys a sense of disappointment and frustration, making it relatable to readers who have faced similar experiences. However, the emotional complexity could be further nuanced or subtle to create a more complex and engaging narrative.",0,llama3.2:3b

* Cultural nuances: The mention of ""magical"" is a cultural reference that may evoke different associations depending on one's background. In Western cultures, snow is often associated with winter festivities, holidays, and a sense of wonder. In other cultures, such as some Asian or African cultures, snow may not be commonly experienced due to geographical location.

Contextual analysis:
- The text implies that the author has been actively participating in or submitting their work for this specific competition.

Context: The text is an enthusiastic and celebratory message from someone who has recently been accepted into their dream university. This is likely to elicit a strong positive emotion in the recipient.

Cultural Nuances: The excitement and joy conveyed by this message are typical of many people's experiences when they receive acceptance letters or news about their future academic pursuits. However, it's essential to consider that some individuals might not be as fortunate and could feel apprehensive or even anxious about the prospect of attending a university.

Emotional Complexity:

*  Strong positive emotion (joy): The text explicitly states ""I can't stop smiling!"" This suggests an intense level of happiness.
* Potential for uncertainty or anxiety: Although the primary emotion is joy, there might be some underlying concerns or apprehensions. For instance, the recipient may worry about the financial implications, academic rigor, or living arrangements at the university.

Realistic Confidence Score:

I would rate this confidence score as 6 out of 10. The tone is overwhelmingly positive and celebratory, but it's not entirely confident. The message lacks specificity regarding potential challenges or concerns, which might reduce the overall confidence in the statement. Additionally, it's essential to consider that everyone experiences a range of emotions when receiving news about their future academic pursuits, making it challenging to assign a definitive confidence level.

To provide a more nuanced analysis, let's consider a few factors:

* The recipient's personal circumstances: Are they likely to be financially stable or supported in some way? Have they overcome significant challenges to reach this point?
* The potential impact on the recipient's life: Will attending this university significantly alter their trajectory or have long-term benefits?

Context - The speaker is expressing grief and sadness upon learning that their dog has passed away after 15 years. They are likely experiencing emotional pain and a sense of loss.

Cultural nuances - The expression of grief in this context, particularly when coupled with the mention of an extended period of time (15 years), may be more commonly associated with Western cultures. In many Asian cultures, especially those that value collectivism over individualism, the passing of a pet can be considered a significant life event and may elicit different emotional responses.

- The use of an extended period of time to describe the length of time since the pet's passing suggests a level of familiarity and shared experience that may be more typical in certain cultural contexts.
- The speaker's tone is somber and reflective, which can indicate a degree of emotional intensity. However, the use of phrases like ""feels so empty now"" suggests that while they are genuinely experiencing sadness, it may not be as intense or overwhelming as some might expect.

Overall, this text presents a nuanced exploration of grief and loss, acknowledging both the brevity of time since the pet's passing and the depth of emotional experience.",0,llama3.2:1b

Primary Emotion: Anxiety or Uncertainty

The tone of the text is one of uncertainty and anxiety, as the speaker mentions ""strange noises"" that they can't quite explain or describe. The use of the phrase ""when I'm alone"" also implies a sense of vulnerability and isolation, which can contribute to feelings of anxiety.

Confidence Level: 6/10

This confidence level is relatively low, indicating that the speaker might be unsure about what's causing the noises or how to address them. They seem hesitant to share their concerns with others, which could suggest that they're not sure if anyone would believe them or take their complaints seriously.

Context:

* The text assumes a private and intimate setting (the speaker is alone at night), which can create an atmosphere of vulnerability.
* The language used (""strange noises,"" ""can't quite explain"") implies a sense of mystery and uncertainty, which can be unsettling.
* There's no indication that the speaker has any concrete evidence or witnesses to support their claims.

Cultural Nuances:

* The use of the word ""noise"" is somewhat ambiguous in this context. While it could refer to a variety of sounds, it's unclear what specific type of noise the speaker is experiencing (e.g., creaks, footsteps, whispers).
* The text lacks any cultural references or colloquialisms that might help explain the phenomenon.
* There's no indication that the speaker has experienced similar issues in the past or with others.

Emotional Complexity:

* The speaker seems to be struggling with feelings of vulnerability and isolation, which can make them more susceptible to anxiety and uncertainty.
* They're also clearly distressed by the unknown nature of the noises, which suggests a level of emotional arousal.
* However, there's no indication that the speaker is experiencing any significant trauma or distress related to the issue.

Overall, while the text provides some insight into the primary emotion (anxiety/uncertainty), it would be beneficial to gather more information and context before making any conclusions.",0,llama3.2:1b

Confidence score: 9/10

The confidence score takes into account the context and cultural nuances of the text.

* The concept of "" cliffhangers"" is particularly prevalent in American television, where shows like ""Game of Thrones"" or ""The Walking Dead"" are known for their shocking endings.

* While the speaker is clearly excited about the experience (e.g., ""My best friend just surprised me...""), it's not necessarily a purely positive emotion. There might be elements of surprise, gratitude, and possibly even nervousness or anticipation.
* The fact that this is a live concert suggests that the speaker may also have some apprehension or uncertainty about what to expect.

While the text conveys a strong sense of anxiety and vulnerability, the emotional tone is not overly dramatic or melodramatic. The use of ""terrified"" implies a level of fear, but it's tempered by a hint of resignation (""I'm called with my test results"") that suggests the individual may be feeling more cautious than outright terrified. This nuance makes the emotional complexity and context somewhat believable, but also leaves room for interpretation or further development in the text.",0,llama3.2:1b
Watching my child take their first steps was the most magical moment.,"Contextual Analysis:

The text is written in an emotive and sentimental tone, conveying a strong sense of joy and wonder. The speaker's experience is one that evokes feelings of happiness, pride, and nostalgia.

Cultural Nuances:

While the sentiment expressed is universal and relatable, cultural nuances might suggest that this experience may be more significant or cherished in certain cultures. For instance, in some cultures, the acquisition of independence (e.g., taking first steps) is a significant milestone that marks a child's growth into adulthood. However, without specific context, it's difficult to pinpoint if this is particularly emphasized in the speaker's culture.

Emotional Complexity:

The primary emotion expressed in this text is joy and wonder, which are closely tied to feelings of pride and elation. The use of words like ""magical"" suggests a strong sense of awe and enchantment. This emotional intensity creates a vivid image in the reader's mind, conveying the significance of this experience.

Realistic Confidence Score:

I would assign a confidence score of 7 out of 10 for identifying the primary emotion expressed in this text. While I can infer that joy and wonder are primary emotions based on the context, there is no explicit language or tone that directly conveys pride or elation. The use of words like ""magical"" might also suggest a sense of serendipity or surprise, rather than an inherent confidence.

The speaker's emotional intensity and vivid description create a powerful impression, making this text more engaging and relatable to readers. However, without further context, it's challenging to assign absolute certainty to the primary emotion expressed in this sentence alone.",0,llama3.2:1b
Why did you lie to me? I trusted you completely and you betrayed me.,"Analysis:

The primary emotion expressed in this text is hurt, anger, and betrayal. The speaker's tone suggests that they feel deeply violated and wounded by what they perceive as a breach of trust.

Context: The context of the situation is likely a relationship or interaction where one partner has made a promise or commitment to another, possibly with significant personal or emotional costs. In this case, the speaker feels like their trust has been betrayed, leading them to lash out at the person who allegedly deceived them.

Cultural nuances:

* The phrase ""I trusted you completely"" is a common idiom that can be interpreted in different ways depending on cultural context. However, in many Western cultures, it's often associated with absolute trust and faith in someone or something.
* The use of phrases like ""you betrayed me"" implies a strong sense of shock, hurt, and possibly even outrage.
* Emotional complexity: The speaker's emotions are layered, suggesting that they're not just feeling anger and hurt but also sadness, shame, and possibly regret.

Emotional complexity:

* The speaker's initial question ""Why did you lie to me?"" can be seen as a rhetorical device to elicit an emotional response from the person accused of lying.
* By asking why they lied, the speaker is probing for reasons that may reveal deeper issues in the relationship or their own emotions.
* The speaker's tone and language suggest that they're trying to process and make sense of what happened, possibly leading to feelings of confusion, frustration, or self-doubt.

Confidence score: 7/10

This confidence score is based on my analysis of the text. While I'm fairly certain that this is a genuine expression of hurt and anger from someone who has been deceived, there's always some degree of uncertainty involved in interpreting human emotions. However, based on the language and tone used, it's reasonable to assume that this is an authentic expression of emotional complexity.",0,llama3.2:1b
Just won the lottery! I'm literally shaking with excitement!,"Analysis:

The text expresses an extreme sense of joy and elation upon winning the lottery, indicated by phrases such as ""I'm literally shaking with excitement"" and ""Just won the lottery."" This behavior is typical of people who are experiencing a high level of happiness and optimism. The use of vivid language, like ""shaking with excitement,"" also suggests an intense emotional response.

Context:
In this context, winning the lottery can be seen as a life-changing event that brings significant financial freedom and newfound opportunities. It's likely that the person is sharing their news with others close to them, which further amplifies the excitement and joy they feel.

Cultural Nuances:

While the text conveys an American-centric idea of celebrating with excessive excitement, it's worth noting that winning the lottery can have varying reactions across cultures. In some societies, modest celebrations or quiet reflection might be more common due to differences in values around material wealth and social etiquette.

Emotional Complexity:
This expression of excitement is also emotionally complex. On one hand, the person feels a sense of relief from financial stress and uncertainty. On the other hand, they might experience anxiety about managing their newfound wealth, security, and potential changes in lifestyle or relationships. Additionally, the emotional response could be influenced by personal expectations, cultural background, and individual values.

Realistic Confidence Score: 9/10

The text presents a realistic portrayal of the person's emotions, considering both the immediate thrill of winning and the potential complexities that come with it. While some readers might interpret their excitement as over-the-top or attention-seeking, others could see it as genuine celebration after overcoming challenges.

Lost my job today. Don't know how I'll pay next month's rent.,"**Primary Emotion:** Anxiety

**Confidence Score:** 8/10

This text conveys a strong sense of anxiety, which is understandable given the dire situation described. The emotions expressed are:

* Frustration: ""Lost my job today"" suggests a sense of loss and disappointment.
* Concern: ""Don't know how I'll pay next month's rent"" implies that financial uncertainty is weighing heavily on the individual.

However, there are also elements that suggest emotional complexity:

* Helplessness: The speaker expresses a sense of powerlessness in their situation, which can elicit empathy from others.
* Self-doubt: The use of ""I don't know how I'll pay"" and ""don't know if I have a job"" suggests self-doubt about their ability to manage the financial implications.

Contextual factors that support this analysis include:

* The text is written in a straightforward, matter-of-fact style, which can be indicative of genuine emotional distress.
* There are no overtly negative or derogatory phrases, suggesting that the speaker is struggling with personal issues rather than simply being careless or uncooperative.
* The tone is somber and reflective, implying that the individual is taking their situation seriously.

Cultural nuances that may influence this analysis include:

* The context of job loss and financial insecurity can be a deeply personal issue for many people, especially in modern societies with high levels of unemployment.
* Self-doubt and helplessness are common experiences for individuals facing economic uncertainty.
* The use of language such as ""I don't know"" and ""don't know if I have a job"" may suggest that the speaker is grappling with feelings of inadequacy or lack of control.

Overall, while there are no overtly complex emotions in this text, the combination of anxiety, self-doubt, and helplessness creates a nuanced and realistic emotional landscape.",0,llama3.2:1b
There's a massive spider in my bathroom and I'm home alone.,"Analysis:

In this text, the primary emotion is fear. The use of all capital letters for ""MASSIVE SPIDER"" and the phrase ""I'm home alone"" convey a sense of vulnerability and anxiety. The fact that the person is describing their living space as a potential threat also contributes to the fear response.

Context: The scenario described is a classic example of a psychological horror trope, where an individual's home becomes a menacing environment due to a perceived threat (in this case, the spider). This type of narrative often taps into our deep-seated fears and can be triggering for some people.

Cultural nuances:

* The emphasis on ""MASSIVE SPIDER"" may not be culturally specific or relevant to every culture, which could affect how this text is received.
* The use of a colloquial phrase (""I'm home alone"") also has regional or cultural variations. In some cultures, it's more common to say ""I'm at home"" rather than ""home alone.""

Emotional complexity:

* The fear response is intense and overwhelming, which may be uncomfortable for the reader.
* The use of all capital letters for the spider's description creates an exaggerated sense of danger, which can be unsettling.
* The fact that the person is describing their living space as a potential threat suggests a deeper anxiety or vulnerability. This could indicate that the speaker is struggling with issues such as claustrophobia, agoraphobia, or other psychological conditions.

Confidence score: 8/10

This text effectively captures the fear and discomfort associated with a potentially threatening situation in one's home. The use of all capital letters for the spider's description creates an exaggerated sense of danger, which is amplified by the phrase ""I'm home alone."" However, cultural nuances may affect how this text is received, and emotional complexity can make it more relatable to certain readers.",0,llama3.2:1b
Our first date was perfect - we talked for hours and the chemistry was amazing.,"After analyzing the text, I would identify the primary emotion as **excitement** with a realistic confidence score of 8/10.

Here's why:

* The phrase ""our first date"" implies a sense of novelty and potential for future interactions.
* The use of ""talked for hours"" suggests a high level of engagement and interest in each other, which can create an exciting atmosphere.
* The word ""chemistry"" is often associated with attraction and strong emotional connections. While it's not explicitly stated that the chemistry was romantic or sexual, its connotation leans towards a deeper connection.

However, there are some nuances to consider:

* The text doesn't convey any underlying tension, conflict, or vulnerability, which might suggest that the excitement is more superficial.
* The phrase ""perfect"" is a bit dramatic and might imply that the date was flawless in all aspects, which could be an oversimplification.
* The tone is quite casual and informal, which can make the emotion seem more effortless than it actually is.

Overall, while the text presents a positive and upbeat image of the date, I wouldn't rate the excitement level as extremely high. It's possible that there was still underlying uncertainty or nervousness on both sides, but the overall tone suggests a strong foundation for a budding connection.",0,llama3.2:1b
The sunset over the ocean today was absolutely breathtaking!,"Based on the context, cultural nuances, and emotional complexity of the text, I would analyze it as follows:

Primary emotion: **Appreciation**

Reasoning:

* The use of the word ""breathtaking"" is a classic expression of admiration or wonder, which suggests that the speaker is genuinely impressed by the scene.
* The phrase ""over the ocean"" implies a sense of awe and reverence for the natural beauty of the setting.
* There is no hint of negativity, frustration, or disappointment in the text, which further supports the interpretation of the primary emotion as appreciation.

Confidence score: 9/10

This confidence score reflects my assessment that the speaker's tone is positive, enthusiastic, and genuine in their praise for the sunset. The lack of any mitigating factors (e.g., criticism, sarcasm) makes it likely that the speaker genuinely enjoyed the experience and wants to share their enthusiasm with others.

However, I wouldn't give a perfect score because:

* The text lacks specific details about the speaker's emotional state or personal significance of the sunset. While we can infer appreciation, it would be interesting to know more about how this moment connected to the speaker on an individual level.
* The phrase ""breathtaking"" might seem overly effusive if taken out of context. A more nuanced expression of admiration could have been used instead.

Overall, the text suggests a genuine and enthusiastic expression of admiration for the sunset, which I attribute to appreciation rather than any other emotion.",0,llama3.2:1b
My phone just died right when I was about to save my 3-hour project work.,"Analysis:

The primary emotion expressed in this text is frustration or annoyance. The use of ""My phone just died"" immediately conveys a sense of urgency and disappointment, which is further emphasized by the phrase ""right when I was about to save my 3-hour project work."" This implies that the speaker had made significant progress on their project and was about to submit it.

The tone of the text is casual and conversational, which adds to the feeling of frustration. The speaker's use of a brief phrase like ""about to"" also contributes to this impression, as it suggests a sense of urgency without conveying a deeper level of emotion.

Confidence score: 7/10

Reasoning:

While the text does convey a clear sense of frustration and disappointment, the confidence score is relatively low. This is because the speaker seems to be taking their situation lightly, using phrases like ""My phone just died"" that can be perceived as casual or dismissive by others.

However, in the context of a professional setting, where saving significant work is a matter of priority, the confidence score could be higher. Additionally, the fact that the speaker mentions ""3-hour project work"" suggests that they may not be feeling overly anxious about the situation, which could further reduce the confidence score.

Cultural nuances:

In some cultures, particularly in more formal or technical settings, saving important work is a more serious matter and can evoke greater emotional responses. In this text, however, it seems that the speaker's reaction to their phone dying is relatively mild compared to other experiences they might have had. This could be due to differences in cultural norms around technology use or project deadlines.

Emotional complexity:

The text also conveys a sense of vulnerability and anxiety, as the speaker is relying on their phone for important work. This adds an emotional layer to the situation that goes beyond mere frustration. The fact that they mention ""about to"" implies a sense of uncertainty and worry about having enough time to complete their project, which contributes to the overall emotional complexity of the text.

Overall, while the primary emotion expressed in this text is frustration, the context, cultural nuances, and emotional complexity suggest that it is more nuanced than initially meets the eye.",0,llama3.2:1b
Finally finished my PhD after 6 years of hard work!,"Contextual Analysis:

The sentence ""Finally finished my PhD after 6 years of hard work"" conveys a sense of accomplishment, relief, and potentially a hint of frustration or exhaustion. The fact that it took 6 years to complete the PhD implies a significant investment of time, effort, and dedication.

Cultural Nuances:

In many cultures, particularly in the Western world, it's common for individuals to express pride and achievement after completing a long-term project like a PhD. However, this sentence could be perceived as somewhat boastful or even arrogant by some cultural or social standards, especially if the speaker is not familiar with or has never experienced similar situations.

Emotional Complexity:

The primary emotion expressed in this sentence is likely relief (or elation). The speaker is expressing their satisfaction and accomplishment after overcoming a significant challenge. However, there's also a hint of exhaustion and possibly even frustration, as indicated by the phrase ""6 years of hard work."" This complexity adds depth to the emotional expression.

Realistic Confidence Score:

Based on the analysis above, I would assign a confidence score of 7 out of 10. While the sentence conveys a sense of relief, it's also tempered with a hint of exhaustion and frustration. The speaker seems genuine in their expression of achievement, but might be slightly cautious or hesitant about boasting about their accomplishments. Additionally, cultural nuances can affect how others interpret this sentence, so I wouldn't give it a perfect score without considering specific cultural contexts.

Overall, the primary emotion expressed is relief, with a nuanced complexity that acknowledges both accomplishment and potential feelings of exhaustion.",0,llama3.2:1b
They diagnosed my mom with stage 4 cancer today.,"Context: The text is likely from a personal or family situation where someone has received a terminal diagnosis of stage 4 cancer.

Cultural Nuances:

* The use of the phrase ""stage 4"" might be specific to certain cultural contexts, as it could imply a more advanced or aggressive form of cancer.
* The tone and language used (""today"") suggest that this is an urgent or life-altering moment for the family, which may vary across cultures.

Emotional Complexity:

* The primary emotion expressed in the text is likely one of shock, grief, and possibly anxiety or worry about the future. The use of ""today"" implies a sense of urgency and impact on daily life.
* The emotional complexity arises from the unexpected nature of the diagnosis, which can evoke feelings of surprise, fear, and helplessness.

Confidence Score: 7/10

Reasoning:

* The text is clear and concise, conveying the essential information about the diagnosis.
* However, the tone may be somewhat blunt or abrupt due to the emotional weight of the situation. This simplicity might detract from its effectiveness in conveying the gravity of the news.
* The confidence score reflects a reasonable level of certainty about the diagnosis itself but acknowledges that the family's reaction will likely involve more emotions and complex thought processes.

Overall, this text is straightforward and conveys a serious message, but it may not be as nuanced or emotionally sophisticated as other forms of communication.",0,llama3.2:1b
"Just rescued a kitten from the street, and it won't stop purring in my arms.","Context: The text is a heartwarming and sentimental moment for an individual, likely a pet owner, who has recently experienced a traumatic event (rescuing a kitten from the street) but has found comfort and solace in the affectionate behavior of their newly rescued cat.

Cultural Nuances:

* In many Western cultures, cats are associated with independence and aloofness. The fact that this individual is actively rescuing a kitten from the street suggests a strong emotional investment in the cat's well-being.
* The text also hints at a potential trauma or stress response (rescuing the kitten) that has led to the kitten's affectionate behavior, which may be a coping mechanism for the owner.

Emotional Complexity:

* The primary emotion expressed is joy and warmth, conveyed through the use of words like ""just"" and ""purring"" in my arms.
* There is also an element of relief and happiness, as the individual has overcome their emotional burden by rescuing the kitten. However, this relief may be tempered by a sense of responsibility or guilt towards the kitten's well-being, which could introduce a layer of complexity to the emotions expressed.

Realistic Confidence Score:

Based on the cultural nuances and emotional complexity of the text, I would estimate that the primary emotion expressed is joy with a high degree of confidence. The individual's tone suggests a genuine and sincere expression of their happiness at rescuing the kitten, as well as a sense of accomplishment and pride in their actions.

However, the introduction of guilt or responsibility towards the kitten's well-being may introduce a layer of complexity to the emotions expressed, which could reduce the confidence score slightly. Overall, I would estimate a realistic confidence score of 8/10.",0,llama3.2:1b

**Primary Emotion:** Anger
My confidence score for this analysis is 9/10.

The text expresses intense anger and hurt due to the betrayal of a long-term relationship. The use of the phrase ""Can't believe"" conveys a sense of shock and disbelief, which further emphasizes the strong emotional tone of the sentiment. The fact that it's been 5 years since they started dating suggests that the pain and resentment have been building up over time.

**Context:** The text is likely written in a moment of intense emotional distress, possibly during or after a dramatic confrontation with the partner. This context contributes to the anguished tone and emphasizes the hurt caused by the betrayal.

**Cultural Nuances:**

* The use of ""Cheated"" as an emotion conveys a sense of betrayal and deception, which is a common theme in many cultures (e.g., Latin American culture).
* The focus on the relationship itself rather than other aspects of life suggests that the speaker values their emotional connection with this person.

**Emotional Complexity:**

* Anger can be intense and all-consuming, but it's also possible to experience sadness, hurt, and vulnerability in a partner after a betrayal.
* The text acknowledges the pain and disappointment, which shows a nuanced understanding of emotions involved in such situations.

The audience gave my performance a standing ovation!,"Analysis:

* Context: The text appears to be from an award show or a similar formal event where a performer has just finished their act. The fact that the audience gave the performer a ""standing ovation"" implies a high level of applause and admiration.
* Cultural nuances: In many Western cultures, a standing ovation is considered a sign of exceptional talent and a gracious acknowledgement by the audience. However, in some Asian cultures, a standing ovation might be seen as more formal or respectful than in Western cultures.
* Emotional complexity: The text conveys a sense of excitement, appreciation, and possibly even pride on behalf of the performer. The use of the word ""standing ovation"" explicitly conveys a strong emotional response.

Primary emotion: Excitement

Confidence score:

While it's difficult to provide an exact confidence score without more context, I would estimate that the primary emotion expressed in this text is 90-95%. This is based on the fact that the audience gave a standing ovation, which suggests a high level of enthusiasm and admiration. The language used (""standing ovation"") also conveys a strong emotional response.

However, it's worth noting that the text doesn't explicitly express any other emotions, such as joy, relief, or disappointment. Therefore, I wouldn't rate this emotion at 100% confidence.",0,llama3.2:1b
My childhood best friend stopped talking to me without any explanation.,"After analyzing the text, I would identify the primary emotion as shock or disappointment, with some level of sadness.

The reason for this is that the speaker's best friend has suddenly and inexplicably cut off their friendship without any warning or explanation. The fact that there was no prior indication of a change in the relationship suggests that the speaker feels blindsided by this sudden move. This can evoke feelings of shock, as the speaker was not expecting such an action.

The text also conveys some level of sadness, as the speaker is left wondering what led to their friend's decision and whether they will ever be able to re-establish a friendship. The emotional complexity arises from the fact that the speaker is struggling to come to terms with the loss of a close relationship, which can be emotionally draining.

However, it's worth noting that the text does not have an overtly negative or angry tone, suggesting that the speaker may still hold some affection for their friend. A realistic confidence score would likely be around 7-8 out of 10, as the emotions expressed in the text are genuine and heartfelt, but also somewhat uncertain and uncertain.

The lack of direct explanation from the friend adds to the mystery and sense of loss, which can make it harder for the speaker to process their emotions. The text's emotional complexity is further enhanced by the fact that the speaker has a clear image of their childhood best friend, making it even more challenging for them to come to terms with this new development.",0,llama3.2:1b

* The text conveys excitement, nervousness, and potentially anticipation or optimism (e.g., ""My crush just asked me out on a date!"").
* The tone is informal and casual, which can make the recipient feel more comfortable opening up and expressing their emotions.
* However, the use of an exclamation mark at the end of the sentence creates a sense of urgency or importance, implying that this development has occurred quickly.

Primary Emotion: Excitement

Realistic Confidence Score: 8/10

The text conveys a clear and positive emotion (excitement), but there's some uncertainty about how others might react. The use of an exclamation mark creates a sense of urgency, which could suggest that the recipient is genuinely thrilled or surprised by the news. However, it's also possible to interpret this as coming across as too eager or presumptuous if the person doesn't explicitly express their enthusiasm.

* The author explicitly expresses their emotions (""I'm overwhelmed with joy""), indicating a high level of emotional intensity.
* There is no apparent irony or sarcasm in the message; it's a genuine expression of a life-changing event.

Someone broke into my car last night. I feel so violated.,"Based on the provided text, I would analyze it as follows:

**Context:** The situation is likely traumatic and has caused significant distress, leading to feelings of violation.

**Cultural Nuances:** The use of ""broken"" in this context suggests a physical invasion, which may have been more severe than what is commonly associated with a break-in. This nuance implies that the perpetrator's actions were not just property damage but also potentially threatening or coercive.

**Emotional Complexity:** The text conveys a range of emotions, including shock, fear, anxiety, and possibly shame (due to feeling like an individual in control of their own home was violated). However, the primary emotion expressed is one of violation. This emphasis on being ""broken"" can be attributed to the severity of the physical invasion, which has left the speaker with a deep sense of discomfort and mistrust.

**Realistic Confidence Score:** I would rate this confidence score as 9/10. The text effectively conveys a strong emotional response that is grounded in reality (e.g., the use of ""broken"" to describe the car, the potential for physical harm). The speaker's language suggests a clear understanding of their emotions and experiences, which adds to the authenticity of the expression.

**Potential Improvements:**

* Adding more sensory details could help create a more immersive experience. For example, what did the sound of breaking glass or slamming doors sound like?
* Consider adding more emotional depth by exploring the underlying feelings that lead up to this incident (e.g., stress, anxiety, fear). This can help readers connect with the speaker on a deeper level.
* The text is quite direct and straightforward. Adding more nuance or subtlety could make it even more impactful. For example, you might express gratitude for not being in the car at the time of the break-in, or acknowledge that this experience has made you realize your home's security is not as secure as you thought.",0,llama3.2:1b

Cultural Nuances:

* In many cultures, expressing excitement and success in professional matters is considered acceptable and even expected.
* However, the term ""dream job"" can have different connotations depending on individual perspectives. For some, it might mean a prestigious role with high expectations for performance; for others, it could be an ideal work-life balance or opportunities for personal growth.

Emotional Complexity:

* The text's primary emotion is clearly excitement and elation, which can be attributed to the accomplishment of achieving a long-held career goal.
* There's also a sense of satisfaction (implied by ""double my current salary"") that might not be immediately apparent in this type of statement. This could stem from the individual's hard work, dedication, or financial struggles leading up to the achievement.

Realistic Confidence Score: 8/10

The confidence score is high because the writer seems genuinely thrilled with their new opportunity and feels it represents a significant step forward in their career. The text does not contain any negative comments, self-doubt, or uncertainty that would detract from the positivity of the statement.",0,llama3.2:1b
Lost all my vacation photos when my hard drive crashed.,"After analyzing the text, I would identify the primary emotion as sadness or frustration.

The phrase ""Lost all my vacation photos"" sets a melancholic tone, implying a sense of loss and disappointment. The word ""crashed,"" which typically has a negative connotation, reinforces this sentiment. Furthermore, the fact that it was your hard drive that crashed suggests that you were relying on those photos for memories and experiences.

Confidence score: 7/10

While the text is straightforward and relatable, it's not particularly nuanced or emotionally complex. The emotions expressed are basic and easy to understand, which can make the text feel a bit flat in terms of emotional depth. However, this also makes it accessible and authentic, as people often experience similar situations where they lose important memories.

The use of words like ""crashed"" and ""lost"" do add a sense of gravity and urgency to the emotion, but it's not particularly subtle or sophisticated. A more nuanced approach might have used phrases like ""my vacation photos were destroyed"" or ""I'm heartbroken about losing them."" This would have created a slightly more emotionally resonant text.

Overall, while the primary emotion expressed is sadness, there are some minor areas where the text could be improved to enhance emotional complexity and nuance.",0,llama3.2:1b

Cultural nuances:

* In some cultures, investing in the stock market may be seen as a high-risk, high-reward proposition, leading to a sense of excitement or optimism.
* However, given the severity of the loss, it's likely that the speaker is experiencing a negative emotional response, such as despair or desperation.

Emotional complexity:

* The primary emotion expressed in this text is likely to be disappointment, specifically related to financial loss. This can stem from feelings of regret for not being more careful with investments.
* There may also be a sense of helplessness, as the speaker feels they have lost everything and are now facing financial difficulties.

Confidence score:

* Based on the language used (e.g., ""crashed,"" ""lost everything"") and the emotional tone, I would estimate a realistic confidence score of 40%. The speaker's use of strong negative words (""crashed,"" ""everything"") suggests a high level of emotional distress, but the text also implies that they may be struggling to accept the consequences of their investment decisions.",0,llama3.2:1b

* The use of ""surprise"" implies that the party is a significant and memorable event, which can create an emotional response.

Emotional complexity:

* On one hand, the text conveys excitement and joy, as indicated by the surprise element and the gathering of friends from diverse backgrounds.
* On the other hand, it also acknowledges that the party might not be universally accepted or understood, which could lead to feelings of awkwardness or hesitation among some guests.

The primary emotion conveyed by this text is disappointment or disillusionment. The sentence explicitly states that ""Nobody showed up,"" which implies a sense of loss or failure on the part of the speaker.

Context:
Given the context, it's likely that the speaker was expecting some form of recognition, acknowledgement, or celebration for their achievement (graduating from high school). The fact that nobody attended the ceremony suggests that this expectation was not met, leading to feelings of disappointment and sadness.

Cultural Nuances:

* In many Western cultures, a graduation ceremony is a significant event marking a major milestone in one's life. Missing such an occasion might be seen as a personal rejection or failure.
* The tone of the text implies that the speaker felt ignored or dismissed by others, which can be perceived as hurtful and embarrassing.

Emotional Complexity:

* The text has a slightly melancholic undertone, hinting at the possibility of regret or ""what ifs"" about how things could have been different. This adds depth to the emotional complexity.
* The speaker's use of the phrase ""Nobody showed up"" can also be seen as somewhat dismissive or sarcastic, which may indicate underlying feelings of frustration or anger.

Realistic Confidence Score:

Based on this analysis, I would assign a realistic confidence score of 6/10. While the text conveys a clear and direct emotion ("" disappointment""), it's essential to consider the cultural nuances and emotional complexity involved. The tone can come across as somewhat abrupt or dismissive, which may not be entirely accurate in real life.

To improve the authenticity of the emotional expression, the speaker could have added more context or nuance to their statement, such as:

* Expressing regret or disappointment about how things turned out
* Mentioning specific reasons why they didn't receive an invitation (e.g., ""I didn't get an invite due to financial constraints"")
* Offering a humorous or lighthearted take on the situation

By adding more depth and context, the text can convey a richer emotional landscape and create a more engaging reading experience.",0,llama3.2:1b
Just saw a huge shooting star streak across the night sky!,"After analyzing the text, I would identify the primary emotion as excitement or astonishment.

The use of the phrase ""Just saw"" creates a sense of immediacy and personal experience, implying that the speaker is recounting an event that happened in real-time. The word ""huge"" also adds to the sense of surprise and wonder.

Contextually, this type of statement can be expected from someone who has just witnessed a rare celestial event, which is likely to evoke strong emotions. Cultural nuances might suggest that this type of statement is more commonly used by individuals with an interest in astronomy or space exploration, which could further support my identification of excitement as the primary emotion.

Emotional complexity is high due to the speaker's personal experience and the sense of awe inspired by witnessing a rare event. The use of words like ""huge"" also suggests that the speaker is trying to convey their emotions in a concise manner, adding to the emotional intensity of the statement.

Realistic confidence score: 9/10

The text is highly engaging and conveys a strong sense of excitement and wonder. However, it may be perceived as slightly less authentic if the speaker were to embellish or exaggerate the details of their experience. A more nuanced approach might involve adding some additional context or subtle hints about what they actually saw (e.g., ""I was out on my back in the backyard, and I just saw this huge shooting star streak across the sky..."").",0,llama3.2:1b
My partner proposed to me at sunrise on top of a mountain!,"Analyzing the given text:

* Context: The proposal is likely taking place in a romantic setting, possibly with a scenic view of a mountain.
* Cultural nuances:
	+ In Western cultures, proposals are often associated with grand gestures, especially when outdoors or in beautiful locations.
	+ The use of ""My partner"" instead of ""my love"" or ""my husband/wife"" may indicate a more egalitarian approach to relationships, which is common in modern Western societies.
* Emotional complexity:
	+ The text conveys happiness and joy, as the writer expresses excitement about their proposal.
	+ There is also a sense of anticipation and nervousness, particularly in the context of being at a high point with little visibility or distractions.

Primary emotion: Happiness

Realistic confidence score:

I would assign a confidence score of 8 out of 10. The text conveys a strong emotional tone, with the writer's excitement and happiness evident throughout. However, it's worth noting that proposals can sometimes be more nerve-wracking than others, and the writer may have considered alternative scenarios or back-ups. Nevertheless, based on this specific text, I would rate their confidence as 8 out of 10.

Additional thoughts:

* The use of ""My partner"" instead of a more personal reference suggests that the writer values the relationship and is not trying to force a romanticized narrative.
* The fact that the proposal occurred at sunrise may add an extra layer of significance, with the natural light and serene atmosphere contributing to the emotional impact.
* The tone of the text is overwhelmingly positive, but there is also a sense of excitement and anticipation. This suggests that the writer is invested in the outcome, but not overly anxious or stressed about it.",0,llama3.2:1b
Found out my best friend has been talking behind my back for months.,"Analyzing the provided text:

The primary emotion expressed is likely one of hurt, betrayal, and possibly anger or resentment, stemming from feeling lied to and deceived by someone you consider a close friend. The context in which this information was shared (months) implies a prolonged period of trust being broken.

The emotional complexity arises from considering the dynamics of friendship and the potential consequences of such actions on relationships. The fact that the person has been talking behind your back for months suggests a significant betrayal, making it challenging to forgive or reconcile with them.

Given these elements, I would assign a realistic confidence score of 6/10. While the emotional intensity is high, the context implies that there may have been some warning signs or attempts to address the issue early on. However, this does not necessarily justify the betrayal, and forgiveness will require effort and time from both parties to work through their emotions.

It's also worth considering that the text may be perceived differently by others depending on their own experiences with trust issues in friendships. Therefore, approaching the situation with empathy, understanding, and an open mind is crucial for a constructive resolution.",0,llama3.2:1b
Got a perfect score on my final exam that I studied months for!,"Upon analyzing the text, I would identify the primary emotion as excitement or joy, likely mixed with a sense of relief and accomplishment.

Confidence score: 8/10

The use of the phrase ""studied months"" suggests a significant amount of effort and dedication. The fact that the speaker mentions getting a perfect score implies that their hard work paid off, which could elicit feelings of pride and satisfaction. However, the tone is celebratory rather than boastful, as if to emphasize the accomplishment rather than simply declare it.

The emotional complexity lies in the mix of emotions. The speaker's excitement about achieving academic success likely stems from a sense of relief that all their efforts were rewarded. At the same time, there may be an underlying pride and satisfaction in knowing they worked hard for it. Additionally, the tone is informal and conversational, which could contribute to a more relatable and endearing emotional expression.

Contextual factors that support this analysis include:

* The use of phrases like ""Got"" (implying surprise or excitement) and ""studied months"" (suggesting effort and dedication).
* The emphasis on achieving a perfect score (a high achievement in academic contexts).
* The tone is conversational, which can contribute to a more casual and relatable emotional expression.

However, it's worth noting that the text may also convey some anxiety or nervousness about performing well, especially if the speaker was under pressure or worried about not meeting expectations. Nonetheless, the primary emotion appears to be excitement, joy, relief, and pride.",0,llama3.2:1b
Haven't heard from my brother who lives in the hurricane-affected area.,"Context analysis:

* The speaker is writing to their sibling, indicating a familial relationship and a concern for their well-being.
* The mention of a hurricane suggests a location with significant natural disaster risks or damage.

Cultural nuances:

* The use of ""brother"" as the term of endearment may imply a close family bond, which could be influenced by cultural differences (e.g., varying forms of address).
* The speaker's concern for their brother's safety in the aftermath of a hurricane might indicate a cultural emphasis on family ties and community responsibility.

Emotional complexity:

* The primary emotion expressed is worry or concern for the brother's well-being.
* There may be underlying emotions such as anxiety, fear, or sadness (e.g., due to the devastating effects of the hurricane).
* However, given the familial relationship, it's possible that the speaker is also experiencing a sense of responsibility and loyalty to their brother.

Realistic confidence score:

Based on the analysis, I would rate the primary emotion expressed in this text as ""concern"" or ""worried."" The level of emotional complexity is moderate, with underlying emotions such as anxiety and sadness contributing to the overall tone. However, given the familial relationship and cultural nuances involved, it's possible that the speaker may also be experiencing a sense of responsibility or loyalty.",0,llama3.2:1b
My art piece just sold for ten times more than I expected!,"Analysis:

Considering the context, the text appears to be an informal statement of excitement or surprise from someone who has created an artwork that has fetched a high sale price. The emotional tone is predominantly positive, as the person seems thrilled and pleased with their achievement.

Cultural nuances: This type of enthusiastic expression is not uncommon in various cultures, where people often express pride and satisfaction in their accomplishments. However, it's essential to note that the language used (""just sold for ten times more than I expected!"") might be a bit clich√©d or over-the-top, which could lead some readers to perceive it as insincere.

Emotional complexity: The text contains a few emotional cues that contribute to its overall impact:

* The use of ""just"" and ""sold"" creates a sense of brevity and simplicity, implying that the sale was straightforward and without much fuss.
* The phrase ""ten times more than I expected!"" is particularly noteworthy, as it conveys a sense of excitement and possibly even anxiety or nerves. The use of the word ""expected,"" which often implies a degree of uncertainty or doubt, adds to this emotional tone.

Confidence score: Based on the analysis, I would assign a realistic confidence score of 8 out of 10. While the text doesn't convey complete certainty or conviction about the sale price, it does express genuine excitement and satisfaction. The slight over-the-top language (""just sold for ten times more than I expected!"") suggests that the person might be trying to downplay their emotions or make themselves feel better in some way.

However, considering the cultural nuances mentioned earlier, a slightly lower confidence score (6 out of 10) is possible. Some readers might interpret the text as insincere due to the over-the-top language and the use of familiar clich√©s.",0,llama3.2:1b
The company I worked at for 20 years just declared bankruptcy.,"Analysis:

The primary emotion conveyed in this text is shock or disappointment, with a hint of sadness or grief. The phrase ""for 20 years"" suggests a long-term commitment to the company, which adds to the emotional weight of the declaration.

Context: The context is professional and introspective, as the speaker reflects on their decades-long tenure at the company. This tone sets a somber mood, making it clear that the news is not only financial but also personal.

Cultural nuances:

In many Western cultures, bankruptcy is often seen as a natural part of business cycles or a reflection of poor management decisions. However, in some cultures, such as Japan or Latin America, bankruptcy can be viewed with more stigma, reflecting concerns about morality and ethics. This nuance adds complexity to the emotional interpretation.

Emotional complexity:

The speaker's tone implies that they have invested deeply in their work and personal relationships at the company, which makes the news feel like a loss of identity or purpose. The use of ""just"" as a descriptor for 20 years also creates a sense of detachment or normalcy around this significant milestone.

Realistic confidence score:

Confidence level: 6/10

This score acknowledges that the speaker is likely experiencing strong emotions, but also recognizes that their tone might be more reflective and introspective than overtly emotional. The context suggests a somber tone, which makes it difficult to gauge the exact level of shock or disappointment. However, given the professional setting and the use of ""just,"" it's reasonable to assume that the speaker is likely feeling some emotional weight, but not necessarily overwhelmed by it.

Overall, this text conveys a sense of sadness, loss, and introspection, with a hint of cultural nuance and complex emotions.",0,llama3.2:1b
Just held my newborn niece for the first time - she's perfect!,"Analysis:

The primary emotion expressed in this text is happiness, specifically joy and excitement. The use of all capital letters ""JUST"" to begin the sentence further emphasizes the strong emotional state.

Context: The context is likely a personal and intimate moment, such as a family gathering or a special celebration. The fact that it's about holding one's newborn niece for the first time suggests a sense of wonder and discovery.

Cultural nuances: This expression of joy is culturally specific to Western societies, where having a baby is often seen as a significant life event. However, this sentiment can be adapted in other cultures where childbirth is not commonly celebrated or viewed with the same level of enthusiasm.

Emotional complexity: The text conveys a sense of awe and appreciation for the new mother's experience. The phrase ""perfect"" implies a high level of satisfaction, which may reflect on the mother's feelings about her newborn. However, it's also possible that this sentiment is more superficial or focused on external validation rather than genuine emotional connection.

Realistic confidence score: 8/10

The text's confident and enthusiastic tone suggests a high degree of self-assurance. The speaker is clearly proud of their accomplishment and seems to be expressing genuine happiness. However, the phrase ""perfect"" may also imply some level of expectation or pressure from others, which could reduce the confidence score slightly.

Overall, the primary emotion expressed in this text is happiness, but it's tempered by a hint of superficiality and cultural specificity.",0,llama3.2:1b
The criticism from my boss today made me feel completely worthless.,"Upon analyzing the text, I would say that the primary emotion is disappointment or frustration.

Confidence score: 7/10

The use of ""criticism"" from the boss implies negative feedback, which can evoke feelings of self-doubt and worthlessness. The phrase ""made me feel completely worthless"" explicitly expresses a strong negative emotional response. However, it's essential to note that the tone is more assertive than despairing or hopeless.

Contextual analysis:

* The context suggests that the speaker is likely an employee who has been receiving feedback for their work, which can be challenging and demotivating.
* The criticism might have been specific, detailed, and perhaps even unhelpful, leading to feelings of frustration and disillusionment.
* The phrase ""completely worthless"" conveys a strong sense of emotional distress.

Cultural nuances:

* In many cultures, self-advocacy and expressing emotions is seen as brave or empowering. However, in some contexts (e.g., workplaces), being assertive can be perceived as confrontational or difficult.
* The use of ""worthless"" might indicate that the speaker feels their contributions are not valued or appreciated.

Emotional complexity:

* The speaker's emotional state is complex and multi-layered, with a mix of frustration, disappointment, and possibly even shame (expressed through the phrase ""completely worthless"").
* The tone suggests that the speaker may be struggling to come to terms with the criticism and its impact on their self-perception.",0,llama3.2:1b
Witnessed a car accident right in front of me - I'm still shaking.,"After analyzing the text, I would identify the primary emotion as:

**Fear**

My reasoning is based on several cues:

1. **Intensity**: The use of ""I'm still shaking"" implies intense emotional distress and a high level of fear.
2. **Context**: Witnessing a car accident in front of you suggests that the speaker is likely fearful for their own safety or well-being.
3. **Body language**: Shaking, which can be a physical manifestation of anxiety or stress.

Realistic confidence score: 9/10

The confidence level I assigned to the emotion ""Fear"" is high due to its intense emotional connotation and the immediate context of witnessing a car accident. The speaker's use of strong negative language (""shaking"") further reinforces this interpretation.

Cultural nuances:

* In many cultures, shaking as a physical expression of fear or anxiety is more common than in Western cultures.
* Emotional expressions can be culturally relative, and what may be considered intense emotional distress in one culture may not be the same in another.

Emotional complexity:

* The text doesn't provide any specific details about the car accident itself, which might imply that it's a minor incident or an accident that was not severe enough to cause significant harm.
* However, the speaker's shock and fear suggest that the incident had some impact on their emotional state, raising questions about the severity of the event.

Overall, the text conveys a strong sense of fear and anxiety, which is understandable given the context of witnessing a car accident.",0,llama3.2:1b

The given text is an example of a genuine and enthusiastic reaction to receiving a care package from someone, likely a parent or guardian. The phrase ""Just got"" suggests a sense of surprise, while the use of ""filled with my favorite things"" conveys excitement and joy.

The emotional complexity of this sentence can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Surprise**: The text implies that the recipient was not expecting a care package from their loved one.
2. **Nostalgia**: The mention of ""favorite things"" evokes a sense of nostalgia, suggesting that the recipient is looking forward to reuniting with these items in person or receiving them as a special treat.
3. **Exuberance**: The use of ""filled with my favorite things!"" conveys an over-the-top level of excitement and enthusiasm, which can be interpreted as playful, loving, and possibly even flirtatious.

**Emotion identification**

Based on the analysis, I would identify the primary emotion as **joy** (with a confidence score of 8 out of 10). The text exudes a strong sense of happiness and contentment, conveying that the recipient is thrilled to receive such a thoughtful care package from their loved one. While there may be a hint of excitement or nostalgia involved, the overall tone remains overwhelmingly positive.

However, I would caution against attributing too much emotional complexity or nuance to this text, as it is primarily a simple and sincere expression of gratitude and joy. The language used is straightforward, yet effective in conveying a strong emotional response.",0,llama3.2:1b
My manuscript got rejected for the tenth time this year.,"Analysis:

The primary emotion conveyed in this text is disappointment, which is a strong emotion given the specific context of rejection for the tenth time. The use of the word ""tenth"" implies a sense of finality and permanence, which amplifies the feeling of disappointment.

Realistic confidence score: 7/10

This confidence score reflects that the speaker has likely faced rejection multiple times before and is aware that it's not uncommon in the writing world. However, the tone and language used convey a sense of frustration and discouragement, suggesting that the speaker might be experiencing some emotional distress.

Context:

The context of this text is particularly relevant to writers who have been rejected repeatedly for their work. The phrase ""tenth time"" is especially evocative, implying that the rejection has become almost routine. This can lead to feelings of frustration and disillusionment, which may be exacerbated by the prospect of repeating the process.

Cultural nuances:

The use of the word ""rejection"" in this text implies a sense of cultural expectation around what constitutes success as a writer. The fact that the manuscript was submitted for review multiple times suggests a level of investment from the publisher and potential readers, which can be unsettling for writers who have been repeatedly rejected.

Emotional complexity:

The emotional complexity of this text lies in its acknowledgment of disappointment while also conveying a sense of resignation and frustration. The speaker may be feeling a mix of emotions, including anger, sadness, and possibly even guilt or self-doubt about the manuscript's quality or marketability.

Overall, this text conveys a strong sense of disappointment and frustration, but with a nuance that acknowledges the cultural context and emotional complexity involved in being rejected as a writer.",0,llama3.2:1b
First time seeing snow in my life - it's magical!,"Analysis:

The primary emotion expressed in this text is wonder or awe, likely due to the experience of witnessing snow for the first time in one's life. The use of the word ""magical"" further reinforces this interpretation.

Confidence Score: 9/10 (this statement is widely accepted and expected in most people when describing a magical experience)

Context:

* The text appears to be from an individual who has never seen snow before, which adds to the sense of wonder.
* There's no indication that the person saw snow recently or was expecting it; they simply experienced it for the first time.

Cultural Nuances:

* The use of the word ""magical"" is a universal expression of enchantment and amazement, common in many cultures. However, its usage might vary slightly depending on regional idioms.
* There's no apparent cultural bias or preference towards certain snow-related adjectives, which suggests that the speaker's experience was genuine and unaffected by external factors.

Emotional Complexity:

* The text doesn't convey a sense of sadness, regret, or disappointment related to not experiencing snow before. This lack of emotional complexity adds to the overall sense of wonder and excitement.
* The tone is optimistic and open-minded, implying that the person views this experience as a new and exciting discovery rather than something they've always wanted.

Overall Assessment:

This text effectively conveys a primary emotion (wonder) while considering cultural nuances and emotional complexity. It does not contain any obvious biases or emotional inconsistencies that would alter the confidence score.",0,llama3.2:1b
Found out my partner has been secretly gambling away our savings.,"Based on the context, cultural nuances, and emotional complexity of the provided text, I would analyze it as follows:

**Primary Emotion:** Shock or Betrayal

I assign a realism confidence score of 8/10, considering that the speaker is likely experiencing a significant shock and betrayal due to the revelation of their partner's secret behavior. The tone of the statement conveys a sense of astonishment and dismay.

The use of the phrase ""secretly"" implies a level of deception, which adds to the emotional complexity of the situation. It also suggests that the speaker had no idea about their partner's actions, making the revelation even more shocking.

The text does not convey any anger or aggression from the speaker, but rather a sense of sadness and disappointment. The speaker is likely feeling let down by their partner's behavior, which can lead to feelings of betrayal and mistrust.

**Context:** The text implies that the relationship has been compromised by the discovery of the secret gambling habit, which may indicate underlying issues with financial management, communication, or trust. This context adds depth to the emotional complexity of the situation.

**Cultural Nuances:**

1. The use of the phrase ""secretly"" might be culturally specific, as it implies a level of deception that is not necessarily accepted in all cultures.
2. The fact that the speaker didn't know about their partner's secret behavior may suggest that they feel betrayed by the lack of transparency or communication in the relationship.
3. The text does not mention any cultural references or nuances that might affect the emotional interpretation.

**Emotional Complexity:**

1. The shock and betrayal emotions conveyed in the text are understandable, given the revelation of a secret behavior.
2. The use of words like ""secretly"" and ""betrayal"" adds to the emotional complexity of the situation.
3. The fact that the speaker didn't know about their partner's secret behavior may suggest that they feel trapped or unable to address the issue themselves.

However, it is essential to note that emotional interpretations can vary depending on individual perspectives and cultural backgrounds.",0,llama3.2:1b

Cultural Nuances:

* The use of ""high-five"" is a common gesture associated with excitement, happiness, and affection in many Western cultures.
* The fact that the dog knows how to high-five implies a level of cognitive understanding and trainability, which may be seen as endearing or amusing by some people.

Emotional Complexity: 

* The statement conveys a sense of joy and excitement (high five) but also a hint of pride and accomplishment (adopting a rescue dog). This combination suggests that the speaker is feeling both positive emotions about their new pet.
* However, the use of ""rescue"" might also imply a level of responsibility or commitment to caring for the dog, which could be seen as more emotional complexity by some people.

Primary Emotion: 

Based on the language and context used in the text, the primary emotion is likely excitement or joy. The tone is playful and lighthearted, and the use of ""high-five"" reinforces this interpretation.

Realistic Confidence Score:

I would give a realistic confidence score of 8 out of 10. The statement is straightforward and easy to understand, but it also implies a level of emotional depth that might be attributed to more experienced or nuanced individuals. However, the language used is clear and concise, suggesting that the author is likely someone who values simplicity and honesty in their communication.",0,llama3.2:1b

This can be inferred from the context that ""she didn't recognize me"" and the fact that it is a family member.

Confidence score: 8/10

The emotional complexity of this statement lies in the mixed feelings of sadness (due to the loss of her recognition and connection) and frustration (as she may have felt threatened or confused by the person's presence). The tone is straightforward and matter-of-fact, suggesting a sense of resignation and acceptance.",0,llama3.2:1b
Won first place in the national photography competition!,"Analysis:

The text ""Won first place in the national photography competition!"" is an unequivocal statement of achievement and triumph. The use of the word ""won"" conveys a sense of victory, which is further emphasized by the phrase ""first place."" This suggests that the individual involved had to go through a process of elimination or competition to achieve this outcome.

Contextually, the text assumes a level of familiarity with the concept of national photography competitions, which implies an audience that is likely to have some knowledge of such events. The language used also suggests a tone that is celebratory and triumphant, indicating that the individual involved may be in a position of prestige or authority within their community.

Cultural nuances:

The phrase ""national"" might suggest a level of national pride or identity, but it's worth noting that this can also imply a sense of superiority or dominance over other regional or local competitions. Without more context, it's difficult to determine the specific cultural implications of the competition being referred to.

Emotional complexity:

The text conveys an overwhelming sense of excitement and elation, as indicated by the use of the word ""won."" The phrase ""first place"" is also a strong statement that implies a high level of achievement. However, this may not be entirely accurate in all contexts, particularly if the competition was extremely competitive or if there were multiple contenders.

Realistic confidence score: 9/10

Reasoning:

While the text assumes a certain level of familiarity with national photography competitions and presents a triumphant tone, it's difficult to quantify the specific emotional complexity of the individual involved. The language used is straightforward and celebratory, which may suggest that the individual is confident but not necessarily exceptional. A realistic confidence score reflects this ambiguity, as the text acknowledges the possibility that the competition was challenging or uncertain.",0,llama3.2:1b
Just found out I got accepted into my dream university! I can't stop smiling!,"The primary emotion expressed in this text appears to be Joy or Excitement, as the individual is obviously thrilled about being accepted into their dream university. This emotion is further emphasized by the exclamation marks and the phrase ""can't stop smiling"".

As for a realistic confidence score, given that emotions can be subjective and may vary based on individual experiences, it would be challenging to provide an exact number. However, based on the strength and clarity of the expression of joy, we can say with high certainty that the emotion is present to a very high degree. The use of exclamation marks and repetition of phrases like ""can't stop smiling"" underscores the intensity of this emotion.

However, it's also important to note that while Joy or Excitement seems to be the dominant emotion in this text, there may be underlying feelings such as relief, pride, or anticipation present as well, given the significance of getting into a dream university. But these are subtler and not as explicitly expressed as the primary emotion of joy.",0,mistral
My dog of 15 years passed away yesterday. The house feels so empty now.,"The primary emotion expressed in this text is sadness, with underlying emotions such as grief and loss. The individual has lost a long-time companion, their pet dog, which significantly contributes to the intensity of these feelings.

Culturally, this sentiment is universal as pets are valued members of many households across various cultures. The fact that the dog was with the person for 15 years adds significance and emotional weight to the situation.

The text also conveys a sense of emptiness, which suggests a physical absence being felt in the house, further emphasizing the loss.

Regarding the confidence score, this analysis is based on textual interpretation and does not rely on direct observation or interaction. The high level of emotional expression and specific details regarding the relationship with the dog indicate a strong likelihood that the individual is experiencing profound sadness at the time of writing (confidence score: 95%).",0,mistral
These constant deadlines and pressure at work are driving me insane!,"The primary emotion in this text appears to be stress or anxiety, as the author expresses feelings of being driven ""insane"" due to ongoing deadlines and pressure at work. This sentiment can be linked to a broader cultural context where work-life balance is often discussed and prioritized, especially in Western societies. However, it's important to note that this situation could occur in any culture where there are high expectations or demands placed on workers.
   As for the confidence score, it's not possible to accurately quantify emotions with certainty, but given the strong language used (""insane""), I would assign a relatively high confidence level to the presence of stress and anxiety. The use of exclamation marks also indicates some degree of emotional intensity.
   It's essential to approach this text with empathy and understanding, as the author is expressing feelings that many people can relate to. If possible, offering support or suggestions for stress management could help alleviate some of their distress.",0,mistral
I keep hearing strange noises in my house at night when I'm alone.,"In analyzing the given text, it appears that the speaker is experiencing fear or anxiety due to repeated encounters with mysterious noises at night, especially when they are alone. The context suggests a feeling of vulnerability and uncertainty as the source of these noises remains unknown.

Culturally, this could be interpreted differently based on various factors such as personal beliefs (superstition, religious), societal norms, and the environment in which the speaker resides. For instance, in some cultures, these noises might be attributed to supernatural or paranormal entities, while in others, it may be seen as a normal occurrence, potentially linked to wildlife or building settling.

Emotionally, the text conveys a sense of unease and apprehension. The use of ""alone"" and the repetition of ""night"" emphasize the isolation and potential danger that the speaker is feeling. The confidence score in this case might be low (30-50%) as there seems to be an underlying lack of certainty or control over the situation.

It is essential to note that while I have provided my interpretation, human emotions can vary greatly, so it's always recommended to have a nuanced understanding and to consider additional context before making definitive conclusions.",0,mistral
The way you look at me makes my heart skip a beat. I've never felt this way before.,"This text conveys a strong emotional state of romantic attraction or infatuation, as indicated by phrases like ""the way you look at me"" and ""I've never felt this way before.""

The emotional complexity arises from the intensity of the feelings expressed (""my heart skips a beat"") combined with the admission of experiencing something new. The cultural nuances are subtle but can vary depending on the context; for example, in some cultures, expressing such feelings directly and openly is more common than in others.

Confidence Score: 85% (There's a high level of certainty that this text communicates strong romantic emotions.)",0,mistral
Breaking news: Scientists just discovered evidence of life on Europa!,"In analyzing this text, the primary emotion that stands out is excitement or astonishment. This discovery about potential life on Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, is groundbreaking and revolutionary in the field of astronomy and astrobiology. The use of the word ""just"" implies a recent development, which adds to the sense of urgency and excitement.

Culturally, this discovery would be significant as it expands our understanding of life beyond Earth. It could lead to profound implications for our place in the universe and potentially spur further exploration. Emotionally, the collective awe and curiosity of humanity about the unknown and the potential for discovering extraterrestrial life are key factors here.

As for the confidence score, it's important to note that this is based on available information, which suggests that credible scientists have made this discovery. However, without additional details or context, a precise confidence score cannot be accurately determined. This text represents an announcement of a potential discovery, not a definitive conclusion. The actual confirmation and understanding of life on Europa will likely require further research and investigation.",0,mistral
Can't believe they cancelled my favorite show on such a cliffhanger.,"Based on the provided text, the primary emotion appears to be disappointment or frustration. The speaker is upset because their favorite TV show has been abruptly ended with an unresolved plot point, commonly referred to as a cliffhanger.

The use of ""Can't believe"" suggests a strong emotional reaction to the news, while the phrase ""on such a cliffhanger"" indicates a sense of incompleteness or dissatisfaction with the resolution of the storyline. This emotional response is common among TV show fans when their favorite series concludes unexpectedly or without proper closure.

In terms of cultural nuances, this situation doesn't seem to be specific to any particular culture but may resonate with audiences worldwide who enjoy TV shows and appreciate a well-rounded story.

Regarding the confidence score, given that emotional reactions can vary greatly among individuals, it is difficult to assign a precise number.

The company I worked at for 20 years just declared bankruptcy.,"In analyzing the given text, it is apparent that the primary emotion conveyed is sadness or grief, as the individual has lost their job and the company they had devoted two decades of their life to has gone out of business. This emotional response arises from the loss of a significant aspect of their identity, security, and likely financial stability.

In terms of cultural nuances, it's challenging to pinpoint specific cultural aspects without additional context, as the text does not provide details about the speaker's background or location. However, the universality of work as a source of income, self-worth, and community connection suggests that this emotion would resonate across cultures.

The emotional complexity stems from the various layers of loss involved: the personal attachment to the company, the professional skills and experiences gained over two decades, and the potential economic hardships that may follow. The text does not reveal any anger or resentment toward the company or its management, which suggests a more contemplative and introspective emotional state.

As for the realistic confidence score, it is difficult to assign an exact number without knowing the speaker's personality, support system, and coping mechanisms. Generally speaking, experiencing such a significant loss can be emotionally devastating, so I would rate the confidence level as moderately low (score 4 out of 10).

Just held my newborn niece for the first time - she's perfect!,"The primary emotion expressed in the given text appears to be joy, as suggested by the use of words such as ""perfect.""

In terms of cultural nuances, the expression of joy upon holding a newborn niece is universal across most cultures, although the intensity and specific ways in which this emotion may be expressed can vary. For instance, some cultures might express this joy more exuberantly than others, but the underlying sentiment remains the same - the arrival of a new family member is cause for happiness and celebration.

These emotions are not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the use of the word ""perfect,"" which suggests a deep affection for the newborn.

As for a realistic confidence score, I would assign a high confidence score (95%) to this analysis, as the emotional response expressed is a common and straightforward one that is generally recognizable across cultures. However, it's essential to remember that text-based emotion analysis can never be 100% accurate due to potential ambiguities in language and variations in individual emotional experiences.",0,mistral
The criticism from my boss today made me feel completely worthless.,"In analyzing the given text, it's apparent that the main emotion expressed is sadness or low self-worth, as the individual feels ""worthless"" following criticism from their superior. This emotional state can be further contextualized by considering potential cultural nuances: people across cultures may handle criticism differently, but universally, receiving negative feedback can often lead to feelings of inadequacy, especially when it comes from an authority figure.

In terms of cultural nuances, the text itself does not explicitly provide any particular cultural background for the speaker or their boss, so no specific adjustments need to be made based on culture. However, understanding that people's reactions to criticism can vary depending on their cultural context is crucial when approaching such statements in real-world situations.

As for emotional complexity, there are secondary emotions layered under the primary emotion of sadness or low self-worth, including frustration (due to being criticized) and possibly shame (in being judged by a superior).

Regarding the confidence score, I would assign a 70% confidence level. While it is difficult to quantify emotions with absolute certainty, given the explicit expression of feeling ""completely worthless,"" it's reasonable to assume that the individual is experiencing a high degree of sadness and low self-worth. However, without additional context, such as their general demeanor or past experiences, the exact emotional intensity cannot be precisely determined.

In providing this analysis, it is essential to remind readers that this interpretation is based on the text alone and may not fully capture the intricacies of the individual's true feelings or experiences. Encouraging empathy and support for individuals expressing vulnerable emotions is key when addressing such statements in real-world situations.",0,mistral
Witnessed a car accident right in front of me - I'm still shaking.,"The primary emotion expressed in this text appears to be fear or shock, as the individual has just witnessed a car accident. It is important to note that these emotions can be intense and immediate reactions to traumatic events. There may also be underlying feelings of sadness, worry, or guilt, particularly if there were any injuries involved.

The confidence score for this analysis is high, as the emotional response is directly related to the described event and there are no unusual or ambiguous expressions that would require further context or interpretation. However, it is important to remember that individuals may process and express emotions differently, so while fear or shock seems likely in this situation, it is always possible for there to be additional layers of emotion present.

It's also essential to acknowledge that text-based analysis does not capture the full depth and complexity of human emotions, as it lacks nonverbal cues such as tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language that are often important in understanding emotional states. In a real-life conversation, this person might be visibly shaken or tearful, providing further evidence of their emotional state.

Finally, it is crucial to offer support and understanding when someone shares an emotionally charged event like a car accident.
